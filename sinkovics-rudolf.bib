   abstract = {Abstract Does affiliation with a business group enhance a firm's performance? What is the potential effect of this affiliation especially in declining economic periods? The literature provides contradictory results on this proposition. In this study, the authors explore the role of business group affiliation as a firm-specific factor and its impact in different environments, adding to our understanding of the firm-growth phenomenon. The empirical context is a large sample of firms registered in the United Kingdom, drawn from the FAME database. The analysis provides evidence for significant impact of business group affiliations on firm growth, especially during adverse economic conditions. However, the business group–firm growth relationship is moderated by firm-specific characteristics (e.g. firm size), and group specific characteristics (e.g. type of ownership and country of origin). Regarding the latter, it is specifically revealed that the impact of group affiliation is not uniform across all countries, a possibility that has been ignored in the international business literature. Among its contributions, this research introduces a novel typology of firms in growing and declining industries. The proposed typology enables us to advance propositions with respect to varying trajectories of business affiliations for firms of different size and nationality/region of origin of business groups.},

   abstract = {In an increasingly global environment, marketing educators face a growing challenge in terms of internationalizing offerings. Much of the focus of recent developments centres on the development of distance education programs, with the proliferation of such offerings. However, rather less attention has been paid to how the new technologies can be utilized to enhance existing, more conventional programs. Utilizing a framework proposed by Arpan et al (1993), Kwok & Arpan (1994) and Kwok et al (1994), this contribution focuses on the application of new technologies in order to enhance and 'internetionalize' extant academic provisions, specifically in the area of International Marketing. The authors contend that the new information technologies provide excellent opportunities to internationalize international marketing courses in a very creative and cost-effective manner. Recent examples of how this has been achieved via the use of the World Wide Web (WWW), video conferencing and other emerging educational technologies are provided. Other ideas as to how these technologies might be useful applied are also suggested.},

However, it is unclear whether the same argument holds for disadvantaged suppliers who face high barriers to achieving functional upgrading. Through a review of existing empirical studies, the present paper aims to explore how disadvantaged suppliers in developing countries increase their profits in the face of barriers to functional upgrading. The findings from the literature analysis suggest that the ability of disadvantaged suppliers to benefit from GVC participation depends on the extent of their managerial agency and their ability to leverage multiple upgrading/downgrading trajectories (whether product, process, or functional) and transform them into profitable outcomes.

Pour les auteurs des travaux existants sur les chaînes de valeur mondiales (GVC), c'est la modernisation fonctionnelle qui détermine si les fournisseurs sont en mesure de réaliser des profits importants dans le cadre des GVC. Mais ces auteurs n'indiquent pas si ce postulat s'applique également aux fournisseurs défavorisés qui, pour réaliser leur modernisation fonctionnelle, doivent faire face à des obstacles majeurs. Dans le présent article, nous explorons, grâce à une revue des travaux empiriques existants, la manière dont les fournisseurs défavorisés des pays en voie de développement augmentent leurs profits en dépit des obstacles qui entravent leur modernisation fonctionnelle. Nos résultats révèlent que la capacité des fournisseurs défavorisés à tirer profit de leur participation aux GVC dépend de la taille de leur organisme managérial et de leur aptitude à transformer les multiples mouvements de modernisation/dégradation (des produits, des processus ou des fonctions) en revenus.

A Tobit model is adopted to examine the export performance of new products. Findings from the hierarchical regressions demonstrate that local competition contributes to innovation, as do firms’ external networks. Firms involved in exporting can leverage their learning and this can be a key driver for innovation. Although higher R&D intensity may be hampered when local competition is high, returnee managers can stimulate the international innovation performance of firms in highly competitive environments.},

Despite the deterrent effect of exporter competition, those new ventures that engage in early international venturing are impelled to keep strategically alert and expedite their learning process, therefore prospering in the highly competitive environment. By attracting foreign investors, new ventures will be able to start exporting early, and endorsed by the knowledge advantages associated with foreign partners the rapid entrants have better continuation chances. At the same time, early exporting in a relatively less competitive environment or without foreign ownership will lead to higher exit likelihood. By highlighting the polarizing effects of early exporting in the life cycle of new ventures, this study reconciles the difference between the process model and theories on international entrepreneurship to some extent.},

   abstract = {Rapid export expansion into institutionally distant locations has become more possible in the era of digital economy. Will such rapid expansion bring desirable outcome to firms? In a context of international new ventures (INVs) from emerging markets, we reconceptualize export expansion speed as the pace of exporting across institutional distance over a certain period of time. We then examine the relationship between rapid export expansion across institutional distance and overall firm performance. We incorporate directionality into export expansion and hypothesize the relationship to be positive when INVs export upwardly to more open countries, yet the relationship to be negative when INVs export downwardly to less open countries. We also hypothesize that the degree of market liberalization in subnational regions of origin of the INVs moderates the above speed–performance relationships. Instrumental variable models based on data of Chinese indigenous INVs during 2000–2009 support these hypotheses. This study both zooms in and zooms out the analytical lens along the location-related institutional axis, examines the joint effect of institutions involved in supranational directions and subnational origins on firm performance, and advances institutional theory.},

   abstract = {Abstract for the Book: The purpose of the volume is to analyze the impact of European Union on inward foreign direct investment in Europe and to discuss what type of effects are being created by this race for FDI. The volume deals with two levels of discussion: First, by looking at the policy issues as addressed by the EU authorities and incentive regimes exercised in single countries by local governments. Second, by looking at company strategies towards location selection and whether there is a trend towards concentration in some countries or regions. Although academically it is still under discussion, most countries believe that inward foreign direct investment is beneficial for local economies. It is considered positive not only for job opportunities but also for tax income, technological development and competitiveness of local firms. Countries thus create different type of incentives for foreign firms, such as; direct incentives/subsidies, tax relief, soft loans and preferred handling. This race for attracting inward FDI has been intensified in the European Union. However, there has hardly been any research to understand the impact of EU on the competition among EU-countries to attract FDI. This volume will investigate whether there is such a race or not and provide evidence from different countries. // Abstract for the Chapter: Foreign direct investment and company's location decisions in Europe have attracted much attention from competitors, consumers, academics and governments. Empirical evidence has been provided in the literature with particular attention given to manufacturing investments. The main thrust in the study of this "race for FDI" has been the relationship between competition and trade policy, regional development, employment generation and industrial regeneration (Oxelheim 1993). From an academic perspective it appears worthwhile to investigate in how far the increase in the importance of the service sector is also reflected in the attention it is given with respect to attracting service-FDI. We particularly look into retailing companies because during the last decade, retailing has rapidly become more and more internationalised and retailing firms are creating high levels of value-added by means of domestic job-creation and local purchasing. Literature also suggests that the retail internationalisation process is idiosyncratic, related to retail-specific advantages, dimensional factors and management factors (Alexander 1990; Vida 2000; Vida, Reardon, and Fairhurst 2000). Successful retail expansion involves the development of a set of network contacts with different actors and interest groups on that market, as well as good relationships with suppliers and other business partners. Furthermore, a solid understanding of the market in terms of consumer demands, the competitors and their strengths and weaknesses, legal and political factors, etc. is required.},

Taking the supplier's perspective, we propose that two types of IT resources – IT advancement and electronic integration – create value for suppliers with respect to innovativeness and market performance. We argue that this value creation process is mediated by three specific forms of governance: cooperativeness, output monitoring, and behavior monitoring. To test these arguments, primary data, obtained from 240 Taiwanese electronics suppliers, are used for hypothesis testing. The survey results provide evidence that suppliers’ IT resources enable them to work effectively with their international key customers. Importantly, of the three governance mechanisms, cooperativeness has the strongest impact on supplier performance, owing to supplier electronic integration. Post-hoc analysis revealed that cultural distance does not play a role in moderating the relationship between IT resources and governance mechanisms in international exchange.},

   abstract = {Globalization drives firms to develop product innovation through their global supply chains. While innovations generated by supply channel members, as opposed to individual partners, are playing an increasingly important role in the success of all supply chain partners, there has been limited research on how supply chain relationships cultivate the process of such innovation generation, particularly in emerging markets. Correspondingly, this study explores how multinational suppliers can develop adaptive product innovation to create competitive advantage in emerging markets. Drawing on the knowledge-based view and transaction cost economics, this study investigates the influence of supplier involvement and other factors on supplier innovation and performance. The results of a survey of 170 multinational automobile suppliers in China provide support for most of the hypotheses. Specifically, supplier involvement in codesign has an inverted U-shaped relationship with product innovation. Furthermore, knowledge protection, trust, and technological uncertainty are all found to drive greater product innovation. In addition, the institutional environment moderates the effect of product innovation on performance. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of how MNEs can acquire local knowledge and develop adaptive products in emerging markets.},

This paper examines the role of IT in the context of international business to business (B2B) relationship and its contribution to supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach – This literature review paper develops a conceptual model of IT-mediated relationships in international supply chain relationships. The framework integrates transaction cost economics and resource-based theory perspectives and argues that IT capabilities facilitate supply chain performance, deter partner's opportunism and this process is mediated by B2B processes. Moreover, environmental, relational, cultural and country level moderators are examined. Findings – It is suggested that IT capabilities contribute directly to improved organizational process such as coordination, transaction specific investment, absorptive capacity and monitoring. These in turn contribute to strategic and operational performance outcomes. Against a resource-based as well as a transaction-cost theory background it is suggested that partner interdependence and environmental, country and cultural factors moderate the process of IT contribution on performance. Research limitations/implications – The paper provides a number of propositions which can be tested empirically in future studies. Practical implications – Managers should focus on the complementarities of IT capabilities. Electronic integration in combination with, for example, human IT resources may enhance supply chain performance and mitigate the moderating effects of environmental, relational, cultural and country factors. Originality/value – The paper develops an integrated conceptual model and propositions which contribute to a clarification of the ambiguous nature of the IT-business value in international B2B relationship.},

In the context of the international electronics supply chain, which is characterized by cultural differences and complexity of products, relationship learning is difficult to achieve and relies largely on close collaboration between partners. The authors build on the resource-based view of the firm and adopt a communication culture theory to examine drivers and performance outcomes of relationship learning in cross-border relationships in the electronics industry. They propose a research framework in which a firm's innovativeness orientation, trust, information technology advancement, and technological uncertainty are determinants of relationship learning. In the framework, they introduce the communication cultures of the supplier and buyer as a moderator. Using 246 electronics suppliers in relationships with international original equipment manufacturer customers, the authors empirically show that innovativeness orientation, trust, and technological uncertainty affect relationship learning positively. Furthermore, the communication cultures of the supplier and buyer moderate the effects of innovativeness orientation and technological uncertainty. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications.},

Previous work has largely ignored the role political ties play in product innovation, and especially with respect to subsidiaries of foreign multinational corporations (MNCs). This study investigates the antecedents and role of political ties in relation to the innovation performance of foreign subsidiaries supplying automotive parts in China. Our analysis is based on survey data from 170 foreign MNC supplier firms in China. A partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach is employed to examine relationships through a ‘soft-modelling’ analysis, using SmartPLS 3. The results empirically confirm the positive impact of political ties, in terms of enhancing foreign MNCs’ product innovation performance in China. Furthermore, it is found that the extent to which foreign suppliers invest in and maintain political ties is driven by a mix of organizational and environmental factors, namely protection orientation, relationship-specific investment, technological dynamism and competitor opportunism. The paper contributes to the understanding of the antecedents and the implications of political ties with respect to the innovation performance of foreign MNC subsidiaries in emerging economies.},

   abstract = {Purpose – While firms have widely adopted corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in their supply chains, there is little work simultaneously examining the drivers and outcomes of such initiatives. Specifically, it is not clear how different institutional contexts may shape them. The purpose of this paper is to examine the drivers and performance outcomes of CSR in supply chains in two different institutional contexts: Mainland China (a transition economy) and Taiwan (a market economy). Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturing factories engaging in CSR in supply chains. Relationships are examined using “softmodeling” partial least squares analysis. Findings – The findings suggest that CSR in supply chains positively impact on customer satisfaction in both Mainland China and Taiwan. Yet, the influence on CSR in supply chains of different drivers differs according to institutional context. In the transition economy of China, CSR initiatives are driven by regulatory and efficiency forces but not by the competitive advantage force. In contrast, in the market economy of Taiwan, CSR initiatives are driven by the competitive advantage force but not by the other two. Research limitations/implications – This paper provides some empirical evidence of the influence of different institutional contexts on CSR initiatives and their impact on customer satisfaction. The research contributes to the emerging theme of institutional theory in international marketing. Practical implications – Managers should be aware that different institutional contexts may shape firms’ CSR in supply chains. However, CSR in supply chains does matter in terms of enhancing customer satisfaction in all institutional contexts.

These included several sessions at the Royal Geographical Society and Institute of Geographer’s Annual Conference in 2010 and the Association of International Business in 2012. The aim for this conference panel session was for panellists to offer a range of empirical and conceptual observations to interrogate our existing understandings of the spatial and historical development of MNEs. While space and time often provide distinct lenses on the operations of MNEs, the panel discussed the ways in which the two can be combined to provide more nuanced conceptualisations and frameworks for analysis, which can powerfully complement existing conceptual frameworks and methodological approaches in international business. This chapter is a record of the panel session and, as such, offers a direct representation of the speakers’ presentations, their discussions and their question and answer session. The chapter begins with Martin Hess’ discussion of continuity and change in MNEs and global production networks, followed by Rudolf Sinkovics’ analysis of the uptake of economic geography work on global sourcing by international business. Liam Campling then introduces us to commodity chains and commodity frontiers before Peter Buckley offers a summary and discussion of the key debates and issues raised.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors conduct a literature review and 50 exploratory interviews with senior managers and policymakers in the automotive parts industry of Pakistan. Findings – The data revealed that three major international joint ventures (IJVs) established in the automotive industry of Pakistan have created significant vertical linkages. However, advanced high-level technology transfer has not actually taken place due to the following reasons: IJV parents are reluctant to engage in technology transfer, there is limited support from local government and local suppliers exhibit limited improvement in their innovation capability. The vertical linkage creation and low-medium technology transfer contributes to incremental product upgrading of the local suppliers, rather than their process upgrading and insertion into the global value chain (GVC). Research limitations/implications – This research looked at technology interactions between IJVs and local tier-1 suppliers (not tier 2 and tier 3) in Pakistan’s automotive industry. This paper’ illustrative case indicates what is required for local suppliers in developing economies to make breakthrough upgrades of their products and processes through their vertical linkages with foreign-owned indigenous firms. Originality/value – Unlike prior research, the authors investigate the role of inter-organizational linkages and the extent of technology transfer, and how these affect local suppliers’ product/process upgrading in the local value chain. Highlighting the illusion of upgrading in the GVC, this paper reveals the difficulties involved in upgrading suppliers’ positions (e.g. insertion and functional upgrading in the GVC) through their vertical linkages with foreign multinational enterprises in developing economies. The illusion of upgrading sheds a rather disappointing light on the position of developing country supplier vis-à-vis their powerful international partners.},

Design/methodology/approach - Data from a five-country East-West published study of information overload in the Reuters organization are used to examine the influences on information overload and to compare the effects on respondents in each country. Findings - Results of the re-manipulation of the survey data demonstrate significant negative relationships between information overload and the fulfilment of job responsibilities in all five countries surveyed. Information overload was perceived to be most stressful in the USA and UK. Practical implications - Marketing managers face the dilemma of receiving too much information, but too little that is “right” for their planning responsibilities. The challenge is thus to convert “information” into “intelligence” that can effectively support strategic marketing planning. Suggestions are offered for reducing the duplication of information and adopting appropriate information-management strategies. Originality/value - Information overload has serious practical consequences for management and planning in marketing no less than in any other discipline. A clear and comprehensive view of the phenomenon and its effects on everyday job responsibilities is therefore useful in tackling the problem.

By drawing on the concept of homophily and tie strength, we argue that, while religion can act as a bridge and thus create a multitude of weak ties within a business network, spirituality can deepen these ties and make them stronger through increased emotional intensity, intimacy and reciprocal service. The data were collected from participants in two Islamic business associations in Turkey. The results suggest that spirituality indeed drives members’ commitment to the network and the presence of spirituality has a distinctive effect on members’ contributions to and demands on the network. More specifically, members who treat their network membership as an extension of their spiritual practice tend to mainly benefit from intangible resources, while members who view their shared religion as an entry point into the network seem to benefit from both tangible and intangible network resources. The findings have several theoretical and practical implications, including the introduction of the spirituality concept into the discussion of homophily and tie strength in business networks, and the role of home networks in the internationalization of SMEs.},

The study adopts a survey approach. 120 questionnaires were conducted through face-to-face meetings with owners/managers of the sample firms. A partial least squares (PLS) path modelling approach is employed to examine relationships through a ‘soft-modelling’ analysis, using SmartPLS 3. The results empirically confirm that spirituality operates as a significant antecedent of network commitment and trust in the context of networks among Anatolian Tigers. Furthermore, it is found that neither length of membership nor firm size have any significant effect on network commitment. The paper contributes to the understanding of antecedents of network commitment by going beyond traditional economic perspectives whose argument, historically, has been that commitment is driven by utilitarian, profit- and utility-maximizing motivations and economic self-interests. },

This high-tech market is characterized by numerous cross-border strategic technology collaborations between software and hardware firms. Anchoring our work in interfirm governance theories and the resource-based view, we develop a model and empirically test relationships related to behavioral governance mechanisms, innovation capabilities, and business performance. In the cross-industry and cross-border context, the empirical model explains to what extent complementary strategic resources, through a relational governance mechanism, contribute to the innovation capabilities of high-tech firms, providing competitive advantage. The data, analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, indicates that technological commitment is a factor in expediting technology resource exchange in ITAs between heterogeneous firms. Technological commitment is captured by the extent to which a focal firm commits to investing its technology resources in an ITA to maintain the relationship. The results also show that firm-level performance is only influenced by market development capability, and not new product development capability, in product innovation. However, we did not find any significant moderating effects of firm size and industry type on the model. This paper offers insights into how high-tech firms benefit from interfirm governance in international technology resource exchange arrangements. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the methodological usefulness of PLS path modeling in strategic alliance, capability and performance research.},

We examine the non-equity-based international network collaborations of high-tech firms as forms of strategic resource seeking within the internationalization process. Within the context of upstream technology collaborations by international software and hardware firms, this paper proposes and empirically examines the impact of resource governance mechanisms (i.e. trust-building and behavioral monitoring) on the exploratory capabilities of firms. The findings indicate that building trust in the internationalization process of network ventures contributes to the firm-level exploratory capabilities and, in turn, market performance. Furthermore, this paper tests the moderating effects of structural capital on the capability–performance relationship. The relationship is stronger when network relationships existed before the inception of the international technology alliance. We also find a negative moderating effect from the existence of an actual alliance and from network duration on the relationship between exploratory capability and market performance. To this end, the longevity of the alliance may not always be something firms should aim for. The paper highlights the criticality of relational and structural capital in the internationalization process and the importance of exploratory capability for creating radical innovation in high-tech industries.},

Combining knowledge from different specialties could be a costly process in the international technology alliances (ITAs) context. We argue that the combination of different specializations requires the development of ‘trans-specialization understanding’ (TSU) instead of the internalization of partners’ specialist knowledge. This paper examines the extent to which inter-firm governance in ITAs shapes TSU, and whether the development of TSU is endangered by cultural distance. We hypothesize that relational governance, product modularity, and cultural distance influence TSU development, which in turn influences firm performance. We collected data from 110 non-equity ITAs between software and hardware firms participating in the mobile device sector. We analyzed the data using partial least squares path modeling. Our findings suggest that TSU largely depends on product modularity and relational governance in alliances. However, while cultural distance negatively moderates the path from relational governance to TSU, it has no effect on the relationship between product modularity and TSU. Based on this, we conclude that product modularity can substitute for relational governance when strong relational norms are not well-developed in international alliances. Thus, cultural distance does not invariably amount to a liability in ITAs.},

   abstract = {Social systems play a pivotal role in shaping customers' views, the adoption process and subsequent product diffusion for novel products. Perceptions of Austrian consumers regarding payment systems were assessed in a cross-sectional analysis applying social representations theory. Social representations help to unravel the sources of individuals' attitudinal or perceptual similarities and differences, which often stem from inter-group differences. In short, they are useful for the investigation of ‘deeper structure’ aspects of consumer behaviour, as has been shown in previous studies. This may be seen as a further step forward for marketing research, which operates largely on social phenomena. This study addresses the shortage of non-cognitive-based research in marketing by offering a methodological approach that uses triangulation on the basis of associative answers from social groups. A four-step analytic design revealed that consumer groups transpose the abstract concept of payment systems into tangible objects and processes in a similar way; however, their social background impacted which value was attached to established as well as new means of payment. Cash is still seen as the prototypical form of payment; newer forms, such as credit cards or ATM cards, appear already in the periphery of representations, urgently needing well-concerted marketing efforts to become recognized as substitutes for cash. From a managerial view, the research employs social phenomena as a basis for segmenting natural rather than nominal groups in order to better serve consumers' needs in an increasingly connected social reality.

   abstract = {With growing competitive pressures, companies are increasingly deploying the Internet (Porter, 2001) as strategic option of performance enhancement. With the Internet representing a potentially fluid and boundary-less medium (Lim et al. 2004), this deployment takes place not only in domestic but also in international markets. The adoption of the Internet appears to be particularly important for smaller firms. They are naturally poorer in terms of resource-endowment than large MNEs (Welsh and White, 1981) and the Internet promises a fast-track and time-compressed option for international expansion (Sinkovics and Penz, 2005; Yamin and Sinkovics, 2006). However, as international business deals with a multitude of contingencies in its environment progressive expansion comes at a price and is increasingly risky (Shrader, Oviatt, and Phillips McDougall, 2000). Internet reliance and the deployment of information and communication technologies (ICT) may implicate ‘ambiguous’ effects (Jean, 2007). The virtual analogue to traditional physical exchange is not riskfree but exposes firms to an array of related risks (Scott, 2004; Viehland, 2001; Wat, Ngai, and Cheng, 2005). While some of these risks are only relevant in the online context, others have their origins in the traditional international business environment. Even though many risks belonging to the latter category are deemed less relevant for companies predominantly doing business in cyberspace, they need to be carefully examined as they might still affect these companies in a different and/or in a less visible way. Understanding international risk in both its traditional and virtual form is thus crucial. While the conscious and controlled handling of risks may represent an important source of sustainable competitive advantage in terms of the resource based view (Barney, 1991), the lack of a thorough risk assessment and of the weighing of the offline-online risk trade-off can not only deprive a business of future profits but might also lead to complete business failure. However, the development of an international e-risk framework is not only relevant from a small firm survival and prosperity perspective, it also contributes to conceptual and theoretical development of international business and international entrepreneurship thinking, as the concept of risk occupies a pivotal theoretical position in both domains. Thus, this chapter pursues two objectives. First, it aims at investigating how traditional international risks take effect in the online context based on Brouthers’s (1995) empirically tested risk dimensions taking a first step towards the construction of an international e-risk framework. Second, it endeavours to explain the risk trade-off between offline and online internationalization for small firms that give preference to a more virtualized market entrysolution rather than to traditional market entry. The structure of the chapter is as follows: The first section introduces the international e-risk framework. The second section discusses the role of risk perceptions in online market entry mode decisions by proposing a simple model based on the internalization constituent of Dunning’s eclectic (OLI) framework. The section concludes by considering limitations and implications for future research.},

   abstract = {Purpose – Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been widely used to examine complex research models in international business and marketing research. While the covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) approach is dominant, the authors argue that the field’s dynamic nature and the sometimes early stage of theory development more often require a partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM) approach. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the application of SEM techniques in the field.  Design/methodology/approach – The authors searched six journals with an international business (and marketing) focus (Management International Review, Journal of International Business Studies, Journal of International Management, International Marketing Review, Journal of World Business, International Business Review) from 1990 to 2013. The authors reviewed all articles that apply SEM, analyzed their research objectives and methodology choices, and assessed whether the PLS-SEM papers followed the best practices outlined in the past. Findings – Of the articles, 379 utilized CB-SEM and 45 PLS-SEM. The reasons for using PLS-SEM referred largely to sampling and data measurement issues and did not sufficiently build on the procedure’s benefits that stem from its design for predictive and exploratory purposes. Thus, the procedure’s key benefits, which might be fruitful for the theorizing process, are not being fully exploited. Furthermore, authors need to better follow best practices to truly advance theory building. Research limitations/implications – The authors examined a subset of journals in the field and did not include general management journals that publish international business and marketingrelated studies. Fur-thermore, the authors found only limited use of PLS-SEM in the journals the authors considered relevant to the study. Originality/value – The study contributes to the literature by providing researchers seeking to adopt SEM as an analytical method with practical guidelines for making better choices concerning an appropriate SEM approach. Furthermore, based on a systematic review of current practices in the international business and marketing literature, the authors identify critical challenges in the selection and use of SEM procedures and offer concrete recommendations for better practice.

The results based on a real data set are contrasted with findings from standard procedures based on CFA methods. Design/methodology/approach – Sinkovics et al.'s data on technophobia was used and re-evaluated using both classical test theory (CTT) (multiple-group structural equations modelling) and Rasch measurement theory. Findings – Data equivalence in particular and measurement in general cannot be addressed without reference to theory. While both procedures can be considered best practice approaches within their respective theoretical foundation of measurement, the Rasch model provides some theoretical virtues. Measurement derived from data that fit the Rasch model seems to be approximated by classical procedures reasonably well. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Practical implications – The more widespread application of Rasch models would lead to a stronger justification of measurement, in particular, in cross-cultural studies but also whenever measures of individual respondents are of interest. Originality/value – Measurement models outside the framework of CTT are still scarce exceptions in marketing research.},

Recent studies either disregard data equivalence at all or they predominantly suggest the use of simultaneous confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for establishing data equivalence. The Latent Trait Theory (LTT), based on a different measurement paradigm, offers an alternative which promises to overcome many of the problems inherent in CFA. This paper contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and illustrates their application by means of a simulated data set.

To explore this issue we draw on three medium sized suppliers. The institutional changes that followed the Rana Plaza accident in April 2013 make Bangladesh in general and the garment industry in particular an interesting and suitable research setting for standards compliance. // Design: The study adopts a multiple case study approach. Face-to-face interviews have been conducted with the owners of three Bangladeshi garment manufacturing firms and several workers. Additionally, organisational documents and local newspaper articles had been collected wherever possible. // Findings: The results indicate that the pressure for compliance has led the case companies to prioritise the implementation of measurable standards over the socially grounded needs and priorities of workers. As a consequence certain initiatives instead of adding new social value in fact destroyed previously existing social value. Furthermore, the pressure for compliance created the necessity to find ways to cover the sizable cost of compliance. This prompted firms to pursue process upgrading through technological advancements and increased work pressures on the labour force. These initiatives led to an increased power imbalance and the exclusion of unskilled workers from the job market.// Originality: The paper contributes to the understanding of the human rights implications of compliance and auditing pressures and initiatives. Furthermore, in order to further enrich existing knowledge in the critical accounting literature, the study draws on insights from the global value chains (GVC) and international business (IB) literatures.},

To this end, we investigate the strategic behaviour of two Bangladeshi garment manufacturers. Both started out as small suppliers for multinational enterprises (MNEs) and have eventually grown into micro-multinationals. The firms are involved in ‘tacit promissory contracting’ with their buyers, a specific form of international outsourcing relationship. The study adopts a multiple case study design that involves interviews with managers/owners of the firms. The analysis yields two key findings. Both firms have devised strategies and taken coherent routines involving actions to develop skills and motivation needed to perform appropriate functional activities (i.e. pre-production, production and post-production) as they embarked on different stages of upgrading. Furthermore, firms have designed routines to internalise the challenges originating from their relationships with their buyers and the institutional environment at the time that had the potential to affect their upgrading goals. The paper contributes to IB studies by highlighting how suppliers, even in a precarious context, can control their own strategies and routines, so as to develop capabilities that allow them to gradually redress the power imbalance between themselves and their buyers.},

   abstract = {Purpose – This paper has two interconnected objectives. The first is to provide a reconceptualisation of social value creation as social constraint alleviation. The second is to respond to the call put forward by Giuliani and Macchi (2014) to produce synergies between bodies of literature exploring the development impact of businesses. The paper focuses on ideas from the global value chain/global production networks (GVC/GPN), business and human rights, corporate social responsibility (CSR), international business (IB) and (social) entrepreneurship literatures.  Design/methodology/approach – The paper offers a reconceptualisation of social value creation by building on the synergies, complementarities, and limitations of existing concepts identified through the literature review.  Findings – The reconceptualisation of social value creation put forward in this paper contributes to the literature in the following way. It offers a useful and clear definition of the term “social” (cf. Devinney, 2009), and it attends to the limitations of the constraint concept as put forward by Ted London and his collaborators (eg. London, 2011). Furthermore, it sketches out the basic ideas of a two-system approach to allow for the differentiation between symptom treatment and root cause alleviation. Finally, it offers a refinement of Wettstein’s (2012) proposed capability-based remedial action concept. The paper furthermore proposes that there are three distinct ways in which businesses generally respond to social constraints. Originality/value – The paper illustrates how the redefined concept of social value creation can connect different bodies of literature and help make sense of existing empirical results, without engaging in definitional debates.   },

   abstract = {We live in a world in which the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services are becoming progressively more complex, with increasing geographical spread and functional integration between economic activities (Dicken, 2015). These economic activities are undertaken within complex and geographically dispersed webs of production circuits and networks, conceptualised by a body of scholars as global production networks (GPNs) (Ernst & Kim, 2002; Coe, Dicken & Hess 2008; Dicken, 2015). Dicken (2015, p. 54) defines a GPN as ‘the circuit of interconnected functions, operations and transactions through which a specific commodity, good or service is produced, distributed and consumed’. The GPN framework has close linkages with global commodity chain (GCC) analysis, proposed by Gereffi (1994), which subsequently evolved into the global value chain (GVC) framework (Gereffi, 1999; Gereffi, Humphrey & Sturgeon, 2005). Whilst GCC analysis focused on a ‘set of inter-organisational networks clustered around one commodity or product’ (Gereffi & Korzeniewicz, 1994, p. 2), GVC exploration concentrated on value-generating activities not only for ‘commodities’ but throughout the entire production process for goods and services. In this way, GVC scholars have analysed the characteristics of value chain transactions by proposing five distinct forms of inter-firm governance based on the complexity of transactions, supply base capabilities and codifiability of production (Gereffi, Humphrey & Sturgeon, 2005). Parallel to GCC/GVC analysis, GPN scholars study the networked nature of economic activities (Dicken et al., 2001; Coe, Dicken & Hess, 2008). They emphasise that, within the changing contours of the world economy, such networks integrate firms, industries and national economies (Coe, Dicken & Hess, 2008). Therefore, GPN analysis adopts the network rather than the chain as the central unit of analysis, positing that firms are part of wider networks of globalised production (Dicken et al., 2001). In this chapter, we refer to these two bodies of literature combined as the GVC/GPN literature. Whilst the GVC/GPN literature places the chain or network at the heart of the analysis, international business (IB) scholars have traditionally been interested in firms, and particularly multinational enterprises (MNEs) (Gui, 2010). The fragmentation of economic activities and functional integration have deeply transformed the way MNEs structure and manage productive and commercial activities on a global scale (de Marchi, di Maria & Ponte, 2014). In contrast to traditional forms of vertical integration associated with internationalisation, MNEs have more recently opted to extend their organisational boundaries to form equity and non-equity based relationships with other actors operating along the value chain, such as suppliers, distributors, agents and partners (Buckley, 2016). Therefore, in order to keep pace with the rapidly shifting world economy, de Marchi, di Maria and Ponte (2014) urge for continual insights on MNEs’ changing organisational forms, internationalisation paths between outsourcing and offshoring, and approaches to knowledge management within organisations and networks. The emergence of these networked multinationals has also changed the process of value creation, and power and knowledge dynamics between MNEs and other actors in value chains (Johns et al., 2015). For this reason, a broader range of GVC/GPN actors beyond MNEs have started to gain analytical and empirical importance. The increasing interdependencies between MNEs and other actors have set the groundwork for analysing inter-firm and non-firm relationships, governance and power dynamics and the distribution of gains throughout GPNs. However, such foci of analysis have so far received insufficient attention in IB and, we would argue, can no longer be overlooked (cf. Cairns & Sliwa, 2008). Not surprisingly then, a number of IB scholars have noted potential incoherence between theoretical progress made in IB and the practical impact of recent processes of economic globalisation (Storper, 1997; Dicken et al., 2001; Dicken, 2015). Whilst IB studies are increasingly adopting network-based perspectives to study MNEs (e.g. Parkhe & Dhanaraj, 2003; Mathews, 2006) along with other actors in the network (McDermott & Corredoira, 2010; Li, Kong & Zhang 2016), the emphasis on internationalisation aspects combined with an analytical preoccupation with Western MNEs is still predominant in IB (Cairns & Sliwa, 2008; de Marchi, di Maria & Ponte, 2014). More recently, a number of IB scholars, including Giuliani and Macchi (2013), de Marchi, di Maria and Ponte (2014), and Johns et al. (2015), have called for interdisciplinary research to integrate broader dimensions of analysis into IB scholarship. In particular, they urge for the integration of GVC/GPN-related ideas. Johns et al. (2015) have pointed out numerous commonalities between the IB and GVC/GPN literatures, noting that GVC/GPN concepts can contribute to key debates and unanswered questions in IB. Based on a bibliographic analysis of IB papers published from 2005 to 2014, they furthermore recognise that IB studies have very slowly been taking up references from the GVC/GPN literature. The authors identify 75 papers published in IB journals that have either cited or mentioned the term GVC/GPN. However, a more in-depth, qualitative examination of these papers was beyond the scope of their study. The purpose of this chapter is to build on and extend Johns et al.’s (2015) work by examining the nature and degree of integration of GVC/GPN-related articles cited in IB research. The focus is on the analysis of papers published since the mid-2000s in IB journals. We also examine the disciplinary origin of the authors as this is an important factor in the discussion of idea migration and integration. To undertake this analysis, we adopt Cairns and Sliwa’s (2008) perspective on the boundaries of IB. They suggest that, in order to critically engage with the nature of contemporary IB, it is necessary to study IB processes as a network of power relations. They furthermore warn against viewing IB as a ‘value-free activity of a purely economic nature’ (p. 162), urging scholars to understand the power dynamics of different forms of networked relationships and the impact of MNEs’ economic activity on other GVC/GPN actors. Subsequently, they call for broadening the boundaries of IB beyond the analysis of MNEs alone, by drawing upon neighbouring disciplines to solve key debates in IB whilst opening up possibilities for alternative structures and forms of IB. In view of that, Cairns and Sliwa (2008, p. 5) adopt a broader ‘stakeholder-based approach’ in order ‘to take account of the different actors involved in and affected by IB’. Rather than (Western) MNEs alone, they consider all stakeholders within the boundaries of IB, such as suppliers, linkage firms, industries, employees, consumers, broader society and the natural environment. In this chapter, we utilise Cairns and Sliwa’s (2008) stakeholder-based perspective of IB to identify the degree to which the GVC/GPN literature is adopted in IB studies. The contents of this chapter are structured as follows. The first section presents a brief literature review on how the IB literature has evolved and taken shape over the ten-year period since the mid-2000s, along with how GVC/GPN studies can contribute to contemporary IB. The second section outlines the methodology of the systematic bibliographic analysis performed here. The third section discusses the findings regarding the nature of GVC/GPN integration into IB studies. This section also investigates the relationship between the authors’ disciplinary backgrounds and the level of integration. The final section concludes with a summary of key findings along with recommendations for future research.},

   abstract = {Purpose – While the internet enjoys increasing interest regarding its potential to extend the global reach of firms, especially small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), little work has been done on the viability of the internet as a new and effective path to internationalization. Specifically, it is unclear how the internet can successfully support export marketing. The purpose of this paper is to examine the drivers and performance outcomes of two patterns of internet use supporting export marketing: the internet as an alternative to a physical presence and the internet as a sales channel. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 115UK-based SMEs involved in “active online internationalization”. Relationships are examined in a “soft-modeling” partial least squares (PLS) analysis. Findings – The findings suggest that online channel support positively enhances export performance for SMEs. Yet, the use of the internet as an alternative to a physical market presence does not lead to higher export performance. Specifically, born-global firms that are relying too much on the internet are prone to fall into the “virtuality trap”. Entrepreneurial firms that use the internet as a sales channel can improve their overall performance, however. Research limitations/implications – This paper provides some empirical evidence of the existence of the notion of the “virtuality trap”. The paper also shows that the internet can serve a valuable complementary role. Traditional exporters are likely to use the internet as a complement to, and thus to support, existing physical operations. Practical implications – Managers should focus on relationship building and on-site learning, instead of putting too much emphasis on the internet as a substitute for a physical market presence. Originality/value – The authors develop a framework and explore previously untested relationships that suggest the internet may play a complementary role in firm internationalization.},

   abstract = {Vorwort: Die Übertragung von Meßinstrumenten für den länderübergreifenden Gebrauch rückt als Folgewirkung der Globalisierung der Wirtschaft immer stärker in das Zentrum des Interesses der Markt- und Konsumentenforschung. Dabei besteht ein natürliches Spannungsverhältnis zwischen Ansätzen, die auf die interkulturelle Vergleichbarkeit von Daten bzw. Forschungsergebnissen abzielen und solchen Zutritten, wo die nationale Abbildungsgüte, im Sinne einer Entsprechung bezüglich des spezifischen lokalen Restriktionsrahmens, im Vordergrund steht. Die gegenständliche Arbeit befaßt sich mit der Prüfung der Anwendbarkeit des Ethnozentrismuskonzeptes im Konsumentenverhalten und entsprechender Meßinstrumente im österreichischen Kontext. Das Ethnozentrismuskonzept liefert einen inhaltlichen Diskussionsbeitrag zur Bedeutung der internationalen Wirtschaftsverflechtung, den Auswirkungen auf Angebot und Nachfrage auf Konsumgütermärkten sowie zu der Entwicklung stärkerer nationalistischer Tendenzen, die auf die lokalen Marktprozesse rückwirken. Aufbauend auf die in den USA entwickelte und in der Marketingliteratur sehr gut etablierte sowie mehrfach verwendete CETSCALE ("Consumer Ethnocentric Tendencies Scale", vgl. Shimp und Sharma, 1987) wird eine nationale Adaption des Marketingkonstruktes in und für Österreich vorgenommen. Im Zuge des Untersuchungsverlaufes wird ein kultursensitiver Anpassungsprozeß ("emic"-Approach) verfolgt. Die empirischen Teilschritte werden in insgesamt fünf Teilprojekten (Instrumententwicklung, N=1105; Validierungsstudie, N=1069; Extremgruppen-Vergleich, N=177; Parallel-Test Entwicklung sowie Konzepterweiterung, N=182) dargestellt. Unter Rückgriff auf ein weites Spektrum klassisch testtheoretischer sowie qualitativer Verfahren (explorative Faktoranalyse, Reliabilitätsanalysen, Clusteranalyse, konfirmatorische Faktoranalysen, Korrelationsanalysen, Kategorisierungen durch Experten etc.) werden zwei Skalenformen für die Messung von Ethnozentrismus von Konsumenten in Österreich entwickelt und validiert.},

New books or editions of existing textbooks are appearing in regular intervals, as authors and publishers aim to tap into the lucrative segment.

Initially I was slightly discouraged to start reviewing this book, basically a function of the book title and the positioning chosen by the publisher.

This selling proposition does not necessarily translate into an interesting read and - in my view - is thus a rather problematic strategy from a publisher’s perspective.  Having overcome this initial barrier, and allowing myself a more involved and deeper look into the book, I was positively enticed by the approach taken by the authors. While thoroughly rooted in IB theory and thinking it goes beyond the often flattening and standardizing writing routines of mainstream IB textbooks, that predominantly address issues of performance and success in culturally and politically heterogeneous marketplaces. The authors writing is premised upon three fundamental ideas, that open up a plethora of rich and inspirational thinking and serve as a conduit in transcending the established orthodoxy. First, rather than conveying yet another primer of ‘how to’ become a successful manager in IB, their book is written with concerned ‘stakeholders’ and ‘citizens of the world’ in mind, who are all positively or negatively affected by IB practices. Second, the authors don’t adopt the dominant paradigm of IB with emphasis on profitability, revenue generation, and market growth and expansion through internationalization and globalization. Rather, they draw upon history and theory to point at the trajectory which IB has taken and provide contrasting perspectives and critical views on implications of IB for nation states, multinational enterprises (MNEs), power distribution between actors and supranational institutions. Third, the authors move beyond the early view that IB is confined to ‘firm-level’ perspectives and discuss firm externalities such as working conditions of labour-force or toxic waste disposal and ethical dimensions. To this end, the book moves IB thinking beyond simple ‘how to’ questions and calls for reflection about issues of ‘why’ and ‘with what effect’. The book generates enthusiasm about ‘what can be done about it’ and thus manages to grasp a unique position in the market of IB textbooks. The book is organized in three parts. Part one deals with theories of international trade and international business, comprising of classical and neo-classical theories of international trade, 20th century developments in trade theories and IB practice and investment theories of international business. Part two deals with actors in international business, i.e. institutions such as IMF, World Bank, WTO, UN, ILO etc. and international business organizations, specifically MNEs, their origin and development. The third part deals with management issues in the business environment. This entails functional perspectives in delivering goods and services such as global research and development, international marketing as well as financial, accounting and governance issues and people management in the international arena. The distinguishing feature of the book are conclusion chapters. These appear throughout the book, synthesize theoretical reasoning and are deemed to poke, provoke and inspire critical reflection of the reader in his/her view of the implications and impact of IB on society at large. Overall, it is impossible to read this book and not to be stimulated about the connections of IB and the challenges which are associated with its organization and orchestration. The demonstration of how power within and of multinational firms and trans-national institutions are intertwined makes this book stand out. After reading this book I fail to see how any serious undergraduate or graduate course on IB, international strategy or multinational management could live without this book on the recommended reading list. While it is truly ‘very short’ and thus may not suffice to serve as single textbook for such courses, it sports an attractive price tag and certainly features and excellent reference list with rich material for further research. In one sense, the authors have proven the marketing team of Sage Publications wrong, it is not only ‘fairly interesting’, it is a compelling and outstanding book.   },

   abstract = {It is generally acknowledged in the business and management literature that qualitative research tends to be ‘messy’. In contrast to the typical linear structure of the quantitative research task (find or develop a theory, gather empirical data, confirm or disconfirm the theory), qualitative findings often emerge through a complex process of gradual evolution, driven by the interaction between theory and data. This iterative, cyclical process can be considered a hallmark of qualitative research. It lies at the heart of terms such as evolution of perspective (Peshkin, 1985), zipping (Orton, 1997), systematic combining (Dubois & Gadde, 2002), cycles of deliberation (McGaughey, 2004, 2007) and the term we adopt in this chapter, progressive focusing (Parlett & Hamilton, 1972; Stake, 1981, 1995). Our aim is to demonstrate how such an inherently ‘messy’ process can be made more manageable and rigorous through the use of CAQDAS. We acknowledge potential dangers in the indiscriminate and overly mechanistic use of CAQDAS (Hesse-Biber, 1996; Marshall, 2001). However, drawing on the example of a research project carried out by one of the authors, we illustrate ways to use CAQDAS in fruitful way to make non-linear research processes more systematic and add to both flexibility and rigour (Sinkovics, Penz, & Ghauri, 2008).},

Yet, a considerable proportion of the qualitative research published in top journals is still presented as the result of a linear, predictable research process, thus wrongly suggesting deductive reasoning. * In this paper, we focus on a particular type of ‘messiness’ where during fieldwork, the research context is revealed to be more complex than anticipated, forcing the researcher to gradually refine/shift their focus to reflect ‘what really matters’. We adopt Stake’s notion of progressive focusing for this gradual approach. * Progressive focusing is well-suited to qualitative research in international business requiring complex iteration between theory and data, and the truthful yet coherent presentation of the research process. We propose that this dual challenge of complexity and trustworthiness may be addressed by using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). * We present conceptual considerations and guidelines and offer a view on a ‘messy’, non-linear doctoral research project conducted using a progressive focusing approach, to demonstrate how CAQDAS can help to develop and re-negotiate insights from theory and interview data, as well as enhance trustworthiness, transparency and publication potential.},

   abstract = {The Internet is widely seen as a powerful tool to help firms overcome physical and managerial barriers to internationalisation. This is particularly true for smaller entrepreneurial firms, given their widely recognised human and financial resource limitations, restricted international experience and lack of knowledge of global markets. Many commentators argue that Internet enablement offers the prospect of removing a whole range of potential internationalisation barriers (Hamill and Gregory, 1997; Quelch and Klein, 1996; Singh and Kundu, 2002). However, while setting up websites implies instant internationalisation from a technical perspective (Kotha et al., 2001), the successful deployment of this virtual presence is restrained by functional and organisational capabilities (Prasad et al., 2001; Samiee, 1998). The Internet allows addressing potential customers without geographical restrictions, yet the successful exploitation of these market opportunities might necessitate learning by (online) experience and avoiding ‘shock effects’ (Pedersen and Petersen, 2004) when dealing with remote markets. Arguably, the pace of internationalisation is ‘compressed’ (Vermeulen and Barkema, 2002) due to the Internet, but it will be interesting to see whether smaller entrepreneurial firms can capitalise on this particular effect more so than other organisational forms. This themed issue aims to contribute to ongoing debate by looking at the interface of the Internet and International Entrepreneurship. It considers important issues such as: what are the enabling dimensions of internationalisation regarding the Internet and e-commerce? Does the Internet facilitate rapid internationalisation? How can we measure a successful online presence of SMEs and is there such a thing as E-entrepreneurship? The papers selected for this themed issue are at the interface of international entrepreneurship and the Internet and follow this theme from general to the specific. The first contribu-tion by Maria J. Nieto and Zulima Fernandez explores the role of IT in corporate strategy of SMEs. Although they argue that ICT does not necessarily constitute a source of competitive advantage in itself, it is the complimentarity with other strategic resources that counts. Their empirical example of Spanish SMEs confirms the existence of a significant relationship between ICT and international competitiveness. Hence, SMEs using ICT tend to be more heavily involved in international activities and demonstrate higher performance results. The paper by Sharon Loane provides a good case for the role of the internet in the internationalisation of SMEs. After elaborating on the ‘born global’ phenomenon, globalisation pressures and the impact of new ICT technologies, she builds on a cross national sample of small entrepreneurial firms from Canada, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Her interview material creates an understanding of the behaviour and strategies adopted by rapidly internationalising Internet enabled firms. Findings reveal the role of the Internet as a knowledge building tool in marketing, distribution, business processes, market intelligence and competitor analysis. Pia Arenius, Mika Gabrielsson and Viveca Sasi present an interesting case study on the rapid Internet-enabled internationalisation of a Finnish knowledge-intensive company. This case demonstrates that embracing the functional capabilities of the Internet may well support the theoretical advantages of rapid internationalisation. Moreover, their contribution is particularly interesting because it supports growing criticisms of the usefulness of internationalisation “stages” theories. Rasha Mostafa, Colin Wheeler and Marian Jones examine the multi-facetted construct using innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking and linking it to export performance. Their study demonstrates that entrepreneurial exporters are more committed to the Internet and in respect of growth in export sales, have better export performance. The study has strong implications for public policy in support of internationalisation, suggesting that upgrading SMEs ICT knowledge and usage will lead to stronger performance on international markets. The paper by Rudolf Sinkovics and Elfriede Penz develops the debate on Internet, SMEs and Entrepreneurship in a pragmatic yet important direction. It explores a new construct of “Web-Empowerment”. Although the quality of websites is deemed a crucial element for the communication with stakeholders, web-design for smaller firms is guided by practical approaches rather than conceptual considerations. The web-empowerment scale proposed provides a valuable tool that can empower entrepreneurs to approach web-design more strategically in order to benefit from a competitive online presence. The final paper in the themed issue by Elaine Ramsey and Patrick Ibbotson discusses e-entrepreneurial firms. The authors take a macro and micro-perspective on entrepreneurial enterprises and discuss e-opportunities for economic development and the internationalisation of small Irish firms. They argue that the willingness to embrace e-business will determine the future success of Ireland in the digital economy. They also outline future directions for policy makers.},

   abstract = {One of the core objectives in cross-national marketing research is to establish research results which are comparable across national entities. Nevertheless certain national idiosyncrasies (unique meaning of constructs, distinctive expressions) may hamper these cross-national research endeavors. Two different approaches have been introduced in the social sciences, in order to cope with this comparability-dilemma. The "emic" and the "etic" school of thought. These can be seen as two extremes on the continuum of cross-national research methodology. The paper tries to illustrate advantages and potential shortcomings of the etic (mostly quantitative) vs. the emic (mostly qualitative) research approach. A combination of alternative, qualitative and quantitative research strategies was used to explore national differences in materialism. A questionnaire was developed comprising both both qualitative and quantitative sections on materialism. The materialism scale, as operationalized by Richins and Dawson (1992) was used, for the quantitative section. The research findings call for the use of 'alternative research strategies' to overcome the emic - etic duality in cross-national research. Comparative text analysis and graphical representations of consumers statements can help to explore the reasons for conceptual differences.},

   volume = {33},
   number = {3},
   pages = {1-6},
   abstract = {1. Advancing the international marketing research agenda with innovative methodologies – an introduction  1.1. About the special issue  The theme “Advancing the international marketing research agenda with innovative methodologies” emerged out of a realisation that significant progress in and around methodologies in international marketing requires systematic checks, stock-take exercises and reflection in terms of where we are and where we are (to be) going. There is a realisation that “international” research has become common practice in the domain of business and marketing (Cadogan, 2010; Malhotra et al., 1996), yet, there the utilisation of appropriate procedures may not always be satisfactory. Data are frequently collected and analysed at multiple levels (Oliveira et al., 2012), cross-cultural equivalence tests prove unsatisfactory and fall short of desired comparability thresholds (Salzberger and Sinkovics, 2006; Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998) and response-rates are plummeting because researchers are cramming too much into their studies and respondents’ fatigue is stretched to its limits (Dillman et al., 1993).  The rise of emerging markets, due to their significant institutional difference from the developed markets, further heightens these conceptual and methodological challenges. Questions arise regarding large bodies of existing literature and how these translate into applicable and actionable research questions for emerging market contexts. For instance, how to make sense of internationalisation research and how to synthesise findings with a view to their suitability for emerging markets? Further, company capabilities are likely to be shaped within business groups and networks and thus social network analysis may become increasingly relevant for conceptual and methodological reasons (Borgatti et al., 2013). These approaches may be particularly useful when studying internationalisation processes of SMEs. How much can advanced methods of systematic analysis help us to reach a consensual understanding out of vastly diverging bodies of work (Borenstein et al., 2009). Advanced research methodologies also push us to tackle new marketing issues and develop new theories for these markets (Burgess and Steenkamp, 2006, 2013; Sheth, 2011). For example, qualitative research methods may be more suitable than quantitative methods to explore the effects of institutions on consumers and organisations at the individual and group level (Burgess and Steenkamp, 2006; Ingenbleek et al., 2013). Significant within-country-heterogeneity in emerging markets may challenge traditional data analysis methods such as measurement invariance and level of analysis. To this end, methods such as finite mixture model and multilevel analysis have been proposed to help remedy these deficiencies (Burgess and Steenkamp, 2006; Peterson et al., 2012).  There is much pressure on the research community to diversify research methodologies (Nakata and Huang, 2005). This special issue was set up with a view of pushing the frontiers regarding rigour and trustworthiness (Sinkovics et al., 2008), for the sake of clearer conceptualisations and perspectives on the real problems underlying these phenomena. We further invited submissions around emerging new themes such as multilevel modelling, meta-analytic techniques, big data, etc. However, few of the submissions received addressed these emerging topics. We see this as an opportunity for future research rather than a limitation. Research that refines our understanding of practices/methodologies in international marketing research will continue to be of relevance in the years to come. The advancement of methodologies is a continuous process, and practices and favourable approaches shift over time. To this end, future methodology focused special issues will have to capture such emerging topics.  1.2. Overview of the papers  The papers in this special issue fall in broadly three categories. The first two papers contribute to the theoretical elements of methodological advancement. Two following papers deal with partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and the last three papers address various methodological concerns that exist in primary data collection process, one of these related to qualitative methodology, the latter two papers focusing on survey methodology.  The paper by Noemi Sinkovics is entitled “Enhancing the foundations for theorising through bibliometric mapping” and builds on the “publish and perish” phenomenon and the pressure of scholars for a share of voice and ideas in an increasingly crowded publication space. The author examines techniques that can help researchers to effectively and efficiently navigate large bodies of publications and help to build solid foundations for high-quality theorising. With a specific focus on a set of journal articles connected to ethics in (international) marketing research, the author explores the software tools VOSviewer software, a package that helps with the visualisation of bodies of literature, and QSR NVivo, a computer assisted qualitative data analysis software that helps to dig deeper and explore specific themes identified through the visualisation tool. The specific contribution of this paper to the special issue is the fact that it provides guidance for the improvement of idea generation, conceptualisation and problem identification stage of the scholarly paper writing process. Most of the methodological advancements found in the literature and certainly also in this special issue usually address methodological issues that are pertaining to the methodological execution itself.  The second paper by Sven Feurer, Elisa Baumbach and Arch G. Woodside, “Applying configurational theory to build a typology of ethnocentric consumers”, is set against a very specific debate in the international marketing literature, related to consumer ethnocentric behaviours of consumers and inconsistencies with regard to its antecedents. The methodological contribution of this paper rests in the application of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of consumer survey data and the efforts to contrast the fsQCA findings with traditional statistical hypotheses testing via multiple regression analysis. Their study has implications for the specific literature domain of consumer ethnocentrism and its distinct types, but perhaps more importantly for this special issue, it shows how fsQCA as an increasingly popular methodology can add value to substantiate findings that have previously been corroborated via more traditional methodological approaches.  The third paper in this special issue by Nicole Franziska Richter, Rudolf R. Sinkovics, Christian M. Ringle and Christopher Schlägel is employing “A critical look at the use of SEM in international business research”. With the development and advancement of new software tools such as SmartPLS the methodology has experienced a new awakening and recognition in various business and management fields. The paper recognises that the covariance-based SEM approach is still dominant in international marketing, but due to the field’s dynamic nature and the sometimes early stage of theory development may benefit from a PLS-SEM approach. The study critically reviews the application of SEM techniques in the field, analyses research objectives and methodology choices, and assesses whether the papers follow best practices outlined in the literature. The value of the paper and its distinctive contribution to this special issue rests with the practical guidelines for making better choices concerning an appropriate SEM approach. The paper not only reviews existing practices in the international business and marketing literature, but also points out problems in previous studies with concrete recommendations for better practice.  Jörg Henseler, Christian M. Ringle and Marko Sarstedt are key contributors and at the forefront to the advancement of PLS methodology as well as software tools. They carry out pioneering work that has led to significant shifts in conversations in the methodology space. The forth paper in this issue is entitled “Testing measurement invariance of composites using partial least squares” and addresses an unresolved issue of measurement, specifically when traditional common-factor models and reflective measurement are not used or applicable. Composite models follow a different philosophy of measurement and are dominant in variance-based SEM. The authors offer a novel three-step procedure to analyse the measurement invariance of composite models (MICOM) when using variance-based SEM, such as PLS path modelling. They test their approach in a simulation study and show that this MICOM procedure is very suitable to analyse the measurement invariance in PLS applications. Effectively, researchers in international marketing and other disciplines will have to consider this procedure and assessment, before any meaningful multigroup analyses can be undertaken.  The fifth paper by Elfriede Penz and Erich Kirchler shifts the focus on “Households in international marketing research: Vienna Diary Technique (VDT) as a method to investigate decision dynamics”. The paper complements the rest of the papers in the special issue as it introduces the Vienna Diary Technique, a relatively time and resource-intensive methodology which is of qualitative nature. This technique has a particular power in research situations when rather small samples are concerned and detailed insights regarding everyday consumption choices and decision making are required. The methodology allows for dyadic analyses of decision makers and their and keeping track of everyday decision making. Penz and Kirchler illustrate in their business partners paper the particular suitability of this methodology in a transition economy context. They outline specifics regarding culture and embeddedness of decision making and thus establish the suitability of this methodology in growth areas or “rising power” markets.  Sanna Sintonen, Anssi Tarkiainen, John W. Cadogan, Olli Kuivalainen, Nick Lee and Sanna Sundqvist are concerned with “Cross-country cross-survey design in international marketing research: the role of input data in multiple imputation”. This is a highly pertinent issue in international marketing research, which is concerned with collecting data from different countries. An apparent challenge arises from missing data and invariance of the scales used. The solutions for these problems might lay in shorter questionnaires and imputation of missing data. The authors propose and evaluate three different imputation approaches with varying breadth and number of variables used for imputing the missing data to deal with the challenge of cross-country cross-survey designs. Their findings show that the imputation that takes into account the invariance structures of the joint items used in imputation (previously neglected perspective) gives the best results (i.e. most accurate inferences about statistical significance of the covariances), suggesting that using knowledge on between country measurement qualities may improve the imputation results. This simultaneously reduces the amount of data used for imputation, however, and the authors conclude that further (e.g. simulation based) research is needed to find the best methods for cross-country/cross-survey research.  The final paper in this special issue is offered by Ruey-Jer “Bryan” Jean, Ziliang Deng, Daekwan Kim and Xiaohui Yuan. The paper is entitled “Assessing endogeneity issues in international marketing research” and makes a unique contribution as this study is one of the first to discuss the endogeneity issue specifically in international marketing research. In doing so, the study elaborates on the origins and consequences of the three most frequently confronted sources of endogeneity in IM research, offering several statistical methods and procedural remedies to address endogeneity for future IM research including some potential approaches in SEM. Given that the topic is drawing attention from the researchers recently, this paper makes important contributions to the international marketing domain by recognising the potential issue associated with endogeneity and offering future directions.

   abstract = {Cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are strategic business expansions across national boundaries, which can prove rather problematic and complex. The most challenging part of the process is the integration of two different firms that feature different management styles and departmental practice. Once the integration seeps deeper into functional levels, strategic-level M&A commitment is faced with operational implementation issues. The marketing departmental function is usually heavily involved in this integration process. Research on marketing integration in relation to M&As has paid little attention to the process of combining similar resources from two similar departments, particularly in the cross-border M&A context. Furthermore, existing research does not clearly demonstrate the success factors that contribute to the marketing integration process in M&As. Hence, this paper discusses the phenomenon of marketing integration in the cross-border M&A context. Collaboration, interaction, marketing synergy and redeployment of marketing resources are proposed as antecedents to the integration. Drawing from the extant literature, propositions are developed, and mechanisms to improve M&A integration performance are elaborated.},

Interestingly, most of the work is based on objective data, neglecting the importance of subjective and perceptual measures of degree of company globalization (DoCG). This study reviews the preliminary attempts to develop a subjective construct and a perceptual measurement tool for company globalization. Based on the work of Cavusgil, Yeniyurt, and Townsend (2004) a confirmatory factor analysis with partial least squares (PLS) path modeling illustrates relevant factors that capture the degree of globalization from a sample of multinationals. Post-hoc tests for the applicability of the generated framework are conducted to examine the consistency of results from the factor analysis. We also test the relationship between subjective and objective measures of company globalization. Although the small sample size does not allow the generalizability of the findings, this study contributes to the body of research aspiring to clarify the nature of a global company, offers a subjective measure for this phenomenon that can stimulate survey-based research with corporate elites, and thus provides a platform for further research.},

The specific focus is on resources and value co-creation with the aim to examine a set of relationships among the 3PL’s resource commitment, collaboration and innovation, and their performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data consisting of 142 UK manufacturing firms are used to study the 3PL and manufacturing customer value co-creation. The confirmatory factor model (CFA) and subsequent structural equation model were tested using EQS 6.1. Findings: The findings show that collaboration between the manufacturers and the 3PLs mediates the relationship between resource commitment and innovation, and performance. 3PLs are becoming much more of a collaborative partner which support the idea of value co-creation strategy. Research limitations/implications: The study is cross-sectional; temporal evolution of value co-creation should be studied in the future. Practical implications: When manufacturers and 3PLs collaborate to target efforts strategically, the 3PL’s resource commitment can be directed towards the development of new innovative approaches. Originality/value: The study contributes to the discussion of forms of co-creation, and theoretical frameworks which would enable us to understand how customers and other actors engage with the companies in collaborative value creation activities.},

Furthermore, the empirical results show that export experience and export commitment reduce managers' perceived internal and external export barriers. The study shows that matching, as a networking-tool at multiple levels, can help to overcome export barriers, thus providing a mechanism to offset challenges opened up through nationalistic policies.},

The literature offers a rather patchy pattern for successful web-strategies and consumer perspectives on what is expected from websites is hardly available.

The web-empowerment scale is based on a large sample from Austria, and developed according to scale development procedures. The relevance of this construct and practical issues in the context of a cross-country sample of SME’s is empirically examined.

The removal of conflicts between residents and international tourists is vital to improve the economic outcomes of the exchange of individuals from various cultural backgrounds. This can help the tourism sector, which is significant factor in the service industry. Data from a quota-sample of 449 respondents, commenting on everyday life interactions with German and Japanese tourists is used. Similarity analysis methodology is applied to [`]link' statements and interpret differences in views towards tourist encounters. Austrian residents view tourist groups similar in terms of brief interactions (e.g. when visiting museums or walking in gardens). However, long-term relationships (e.g. kindergarten and schools vs. personal invitation to homes) manifest themselves differently. The cognitive structures of interaction we identify can be seen as conflict-coping strategies. For residents, social distance serves as a means to avoid malfunctioning relationships. In that respect, Austrians are more reluctant to engage in personal interactions with Japanese tourists than with German tourists. The paper concludes with managerial recommendations for international business and tourism managers that are designed to improve social and economic performance of interaction.},

Cultural dimensions, most importantly language, play a central role in this research context. The importance of language in the context of questionnaire design and international data gathering has long been stressed in various sources (Pike 1966; Brislin 1970; Piekkari & Welch 2004). However, the practice of qualitative data collection and analysis has not been addressed sufficiently, although new and innovative software-based tools are available to help these efforts. This paper deals with methodological and practical issues in analysing qualitative interviews with corporate elites. We illustrate conceptual challenges in setting up qualitative projects that build on interviewing corporate elites and address practical implementation issues in terms of multilingual coding, node creation and theory building by means of computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). To this end a specific empirical example will be used. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

For qualitative research, however, the role of these dimensions is blurred. Some researchers argue that these dimensions are not applicable to qualitative research and a qualitative researcher’s tool chest should be geared towards trustworthiness and encompass issues such as credibility, dependability, transferability and confirmability. This paper advocates the use of formalised and software-based procedures for the analysis and interpretation of qualitative interview data. It is argued that International Business research, with a focus on international datasets, equivalence issues, multiple research environments and multiple researchers, will benefit from formalisation. The use of software programmes is deemed to help to substantiate the analysis and interpretation of textual interview data.},

These new tools, online communities, virtual communities and virtual worlds have emerged as a fascinating and useful pool of collective experience for international business. However, the utilization and analysis of this body of knowledge for international business decisions is still in its infancy. This paper analyzes the potential of these tools to inform international business decisions.

This article addresses this shortcoming by providing an empirical understanding of the perceived usefulness and value of master?s-level dissertations and evaluating their impact on the personal and intellectual development of students. Findings demonstrate the unique ability of the dissertation to enhance student employability, both for scientifically interested and deep learners as well as for functional learners.},

Strategy influences and directs the conduct of day-to-day business operations. It also provides a foundation for longterm success. However, the strategy-performance relationship may not be direct, especially given the increased reliance upon relationships to achieve strategic goals. In fact, previous research has conceptualized an indirect relationship between strategic orientation and performance (Han, Kim, and Srivastava 1998). Organizational capabilities may impact performance as well, i.e., mediate the strategy-performance relationship. If efforts are focused on developing the "right" capabilities, performance will be enhanced.
The current study empirically investigates proposed, theoretically-based relationships between strategy and performance within an interorganizational context. i.e., manufacturer - 3PL (thirdparty logistics providers) relationships. Capabilities within this context are operationalized in terms of operational flexibility and collaboration. These capabilities are enhanced through interaction between the firms. In the following sections, relevant literature is reviewed and used to introduce key constructs and develop a model of the proposed relationships. The presentation of research hypotheses, discussion of research methodology, results, and the theoretical/managerial implications of the research follow this section.},

   journal = {International Marketing Review},
   volume = {23},
   number = {4},
   pages = {349-352},
   abstract = {“Issues and advances in international marketing research” is the title of this special issue of IMR. With an unprecedented proliferation of research methodologies, processes and procedures over the last couple of years, some readers might find that there is not much room for further advancement. In fact, this theme has been selected because, despite progress and methodological advancements, liberalising markets and technology impacts prompt for even more methodological and conceptual rigour when conducting research across borders. It has been argued that market dynamics and global competitive pressures create new challenges for researchers and companies (e.g. Craig and Douglas, 2001) and call for a diversification of research methods (Nakata and Huang, 2005). International marketing research is challenged in two significant ways. Firstly, it needs to fulfil the intrinsic quest for extending and also transcending boundaries, which is characteristic of any scientific research. The process of internationalisation and globalisation, however, represents a powerful external trigger specifically for cross-national research. Secondly, international research entails additional methodological problems due to the increased complexity making it exceptionally prone to errors and misleading conclusions. These challenges persist, irrespective of paradigmatic views, whether following a qualitative or quantitative perspective. The call for papers solicited topics including reliability and validity issues in international marketing research, safeguarding equivalence in cross-national/cross-cultural research, construct measurement issues, development of frameworks for construct measurement, demonstration of appropriate modelling techniques, innovative qualitative designs, techniques or experiments and applications of tools or techniques for cross-cultural studies from other disciplines. The call for papers prompted submission of 19 papers. This somewhat modest response was surprising to us, but may indicate that the next wave of methodological advancements and methodological pluralism is yet to come. Most of the contributions were following quantitative methodology and while companies are said to direct an increasing share of their market research budgets to qualitative designs, the submissions to this special issue did not mirror this development. Additionally, our invitation for comparative ethnography was not taken up, and we believe that there is still much room for the application of tools and techniques such as simulations. In all, “advancement in international marketing research” appears to be incremental, focusing on established methodologies, rather than radical, in terms of pushing us towards fundamentally new research avenues. Of the papers received, 13 passed a first screening by the guest editors and were subsequently subjected to a more thorough review process, strictly following the IMR procedures (2-3 double-blind peer-reviews). One of these papers is authored by the guest editors, yet was as a matter of course also subjected to the review process. The review process resulted in five manuscripts accepted for publication in this special issue. All manuscripts include empirical foundations to varying degrees. The first paper of this special issue by Albert Caruana and Michael T. Ewing looks at the psychometric properties of eTail quality across different product categories in three countries. The testing procedures for conceptual and psychometric equivalence are a useful showcase for equivalence testing. This paper also makes a strong argument in favour of replication and extension research in International Marketing Research. While scholars agree that building on established work is worthwhile and scientifically meritorious, published papers in marketing journals provide scant evidence. This paper is a replication with extension that examines the applicability of online service quality. It tests whether earlier US based findings can be generalised to other countries. Rosanna Garcia and Destan Kandemir explore how moderation can and should be modeled in cross-national/cultural contexts. They build on a multi-national study of consumer involvement to demonstrate appropriate methods for modelling different types of moderation. Specifically, they demonstrate how to identify form and strength moderators. Form moderators are modelled using multiplicative interactions while strength moderators are modelled using multi-group SEM. The authors provide a valuable research framework which should help to utilise their approach with cross-country datasets. The guest editors to this special issue, Thomas Salzberger and Rudolf Sinkovics, are “Reconsidering the problem of data equivalence in international marketing research”. The paper contrasts approaches of equivalence testing based on CFA and the Rasch model for measurement by reanalysing a cross-country dataset on technophobia. Data equivalence is closely connected to the measurement theory employed. While most international marketing research builds on classical test theory, recently, approaches based on item response theory, or latent trait theory (LTT), have been suggested as a promising alternative to this standard paradigm (Schaffer and Riordan, 2003; Singh, 2004). Given very attractive features of this paradigm, which is well adopted in other disciplines, the authors introduce the Rasch (1960) model, which is a special class of LTT models, to international marketing research. Elfriede Penz, in her paper “Researching the socio-cultural context: putting social representations theory into action” demonstrates the value of boundary-spanning of academic disciplines. She applies the social representations theory, which originates in the social psychology literature, to the context of international marketing research. This is important because the marketing community will not necessarily be familiar with the reasoning of this branch of the literature, built around some French authors. It is also innovative because the social representations theory is utilised to study what members of a certain culture think of objects and products, which values they associate with these and which norms they follow. In practical research terms, the contribution is that social representations go beyond the traditional confines of groups and/or multidimensional research methodologies with individual views and perspectives. Finally, the paper by Sharon Loane, Jim Bell and Rod McNaughton, posits that new information communication technologies (ICT), particularly the Internet, can significantly improve the robustness of qualitative and mixed-method international marketing research. The authors describe and evaluate the application of ICT in a cross-national study of rapidly internationalising small firms. They develop a conceptual framework and outline how the appropriate integration of ICT into the research process can help to refine sample identification and selection procedures, improve response rates and encourage greater respondent “buy-in” to depth interviews.},

   volume = {3},
   number = {4},
   pages = {288-290},
   abstract = {Devoting a special issue of CPoIB to the ‘paradoxical nature’ of the internet in International Business was deemed appropriate and timely, as the role of the medium is often unjustly exaggerated in relation to both International Business theory and practical application. The aim of this issue of CPOIB was to bring together research that provides a basis for understanding novel IB phenomena, facilitated by the emergence the internet. The papers which are included in the special issue cover areas of firm internationalisation, ICT facilitated relationships between small and large firms, ICT-enabled structural change in Multinational companies and ICT impact on the customer and supplier relationships. According to the Merritt–Webster online dictionary, a paradox entails having ‘seemingly contradictory qualities’. In this sense the internet medium and ICT more generally does seem to have paradoxical impact on international business activity and management. The papers included in the special issue each highlight a distinct dimension of the internet/ICT paradox in the context of international business. Thus whilst the internet can justly be credited with removing some barriers to growth and international scope of small businesses (Bell 1995; Lituchy and Rail 2000), in speeding internationalization it may remove or reduce opportunities for learning about market environments. Fast internationalisation may also become ‘ignorant’ internationalization as the paper by Foregren and Hagström (2007) illustrates. As regards the interrelationship between MNEs and their SME suppliers as the paper by Jean (2007) argues, ICT applications on the one hand promise more transparent and efficient governance and gains for all parties but at the same time increase the power of the MNE purchasers and increase SME dependence. In the literature there is a recognition that ICT applications reinforce centralizing tendencies in MNE hierarchies (Cowling and Tomlinson 2005; Kim, Park, and Prescott 2003). Some recent research in fact has suggested that the internet and digitalization is facilitating radical changes in the structure of big business (such as the growth of modular production contract manufacturing and the ‘flagship’ multinationals (Nolan, Sutherland, and Zhang 2002). However the paradoxical nature of this outcome is not usually stressed. Yamin and Sinkovics (2007) argue that ICT application involves a ‘control paradox’ in the sense that by increasing the power of the centre the ICT application may simultaneously reduce or even destroy the organisational adaptability that is arguably a potential advantage of multinational corporations. The two other papers included in the special issue provide broader perspectives on the ICT paradox. Fikircoka (2007) offers a critical assessment of the digital economy, based on an inter-disciplinary literature survey that brings together pieces of work that have previously been analysed largely in a separate manner. Finally the paper by Penz (2007) takes a fresh look at the Internet’s paradoxical nature from a consumer point of view. It is argued that some of the Internet’s paradoxical effects stem from socio-political and socio-cultural changes, for example, a power shift from companies to consumers, and normative and anti-normative behaviours.},

Drawing on elements provided by cognitive appraisal theory, affective events theory, the literature on the merger syndrome, and qualitative in-depth interviews with employees, this paper introduces an analytical framework for investigating the role of emotions in international mergers and acquisitions. The qualitative analysis of four cross-border M&A cases focuses on the impact of managerial communication and behaviour on employee emotions, behaviour, and performance.

   abstract = {Introduction - Multinational corporations (MNCs) have been recognized as the key agents of globalization. Rugman and Verbeke (2004) highlight the fact that most MNCs’ sales are within their home region, namely in North America, the European Union and Asia. On the other hand, Dunning and Lundan (2008) emphasize that MNCs are deemed to be not only bringers of economic development but also agents of social well-being, especially in less developed countries. Thus, a growing number of MNCs are altering their strategies to play a substantial role as regional agents to solve social challenges. They are embracing a new approach to corporate social responsibility (CSR) by reformulating their CSR activities. They identify social problems, not as a challenge to be avoided, but as a profitable opportunity that can be seized. Among various social problems, this paper will focus on poverty, which has inspired MNCs’ efforts in less developed countries (London and Hart, 2004; Prahalad, 2009). For instance, the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) approach explains the new strategy for implementing social responsibility and poverty reduction as well as making profit. In his seminal book, The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, Prahalad (2004) provides examples of pioneering MNCs in emerging markets that have modified their businesses and processes. As in many emerging fields, most of the examples and case studies about the innovative initiatives of MNCs in offering sustainable solutions to social hurdles are fragmented and there have been few attempts to provide a theoretical explanation. Thus, this research aims to bridge this gap by borrowing the literature from entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship domains. The primary contribution of this chapter will be to offer a theoretical clarification of the socially entrepreneurial behaviour of MNCs. Moreover, this conceptual work will contribute to extending the literature of international business and social entrepreneurship (SE) by offering the term ‘corporate social entrepreneurship’ as a new avenue for learning about MNCs’ role as social agents.},

Results indicate that within the International Business (IB) domain, JIBS continues to top the list, JWB has solidified its position and joined the upper tier of IB journals, the space below JIBS and JWB is increasingly contested, pointing to the emergence of a multi-tier set of “core” IB journals. In the wider competitive landscape of management and business journals, IB journals perform well in the upper tier, but there is a long tail of IB journals at the lower end of our meta-ranking.},

Drawing from the resource-based view, we propose that manufacturers need to develop stronger local market competence while simultaneously minimizing the costs of distributor opportunism in order to compete successfully in the export market. Cultural distance and other barriers, however, may hinder the development of local market competence for the manufacturer while contributing to the occurrence of distributor opportunism. In order to overcome these barriers, we examine the impact of three alternative forms of manufacturer governance – trust, knowledge sharing, and contract-based relationship – in export channels. Findings suggest that all three governance mechanisms contribute to enhancing the manufacturer's competence to exploit local market opportunity. However, of the three, trust seems to be the only effective way to curtail distributor opportunism.},

   abstract = {This paper seeks to investigate how cross-border commerce via online media is affected the incidence of psychic distance. The term psychic distance is normally understood as the degree to which a firm is uncertain about the environment in a foreign market. This uncertainty is important because it is a major cause of marketing blunders, even by firms that are generally recognised as possessing market prowess and the skills to analyse and understand customer behaviour. The literature on traditional patterns of internationalisation implicitly links the concept of psychic to the notion of organisational learning, whereby predominantly tacit knowledge relating to locally embedded customer behaviour patterns is the key impediment to a full understanding of market conditions. This literature thus strongly suggests that formal knowledge acquisition, e.g. through market research prior to entry is not likely to dilute psychic distance in a significant way. The key to reducing psychic distance is experiential and operational experience, gained cumulatively through the process of local market interactions. It is apparent that a process of pure online internationalisation reduces opportunities for experiential learning and to that extent undermines the process of organisational learning, focussed on market and consumer environments. On the other hand, a key feature of online commerce is that it potentially provides for closer customer intimacy and information exchange. This may have the affect of reducing psychic distance as the online dialogue with consumers may prod the marketer to a better realisation of some cultural and local determinants of customer demand. However, this cannot necessarily be regarded as a reliable basis for learning about particular foreign markets. At best therefore online customer activism is only an imperfect substitute for experiential learning from physical operations on specific markets. There is therefore uncertainty as to whether online cross-border commerce may be subject to high or low degrees of psychic distance. Furthermore there is a total absence of empirical work focussing on psychic distance in the context of online commerce and customer interaction.  This paper seeks to remedy this gap and provide exploratory insights into the phenomenon of psychic distance and online internationalisation. The focus is on the development of propositions for how psychic distance plays out in the context of online commerce. The propositions will need to reflect the diversity of online commerce, for example it might be expected that online commerce of digital products may be subject to much lower degrees of psychic distance, whereas online commerce of atom-based products may be subject to higher psychic distance levels.},

   abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to aim to highlight the ICT-enabled enhancement of control capability in MNEs. The literature on MNE structures acknowledges the role of ICT as a support system, but the specific changes facilitated by ICT have remained significantly underdeveloped. The paper seeks to address this issue conceptually and link contemporary ICT advancement with changes in MNE strategy or structure. The paper further posits that certain applications of ICT may paradoxically reduce a key advantage of multinationality. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is of conceptual nature and critically examines and develops literature to generate insight on the implications of ICT applications for MNE development. Specifically the focus is on enterprise resource planning systems (ERPs) and the impact of enhanced visibility of remote operations to headquarter management. Findings – The finding is that ICT application entails a possible trade-off. It may facilitate an enhancement of control capability for MNE headquarters, however, potentially entails the risk of lessened adaptive capability of subsidiaries, thus potentially constraining the long-term viability of MNE operations: Practical implications – Whilst ICT applications may improve coordination and control for the MNE, a level of subsidiary autonomy and initiative taking is still beneficial for MNE strategic and organisational development. ICT applications should not go so far as to suppress it. To this end, managers may be advised to purposefully “blur” subsidiary visibility, by, e.g. allowing the use of different ERP systems. Originality/value – The main contribution is the integration of literature on ICT advancements, specifically the application of enterprise resource planning systems (ERP), into the IB literature.},

The justification for this argument arises from the low developmental impact of current FDI patterns and from rising costs of attracting increasingly footloose investment. The overall effect is to aggravate government financial constraints on the development of basic infrastructure. We develop propositions for future empirical research. We also consider implications for MNE strategy and argue that current MNE strategies are not only ineffective for delivering poverty reduction but that current strategies in developing countries do not necessarily serve the interest of MNEs either.},

Although subsidiaries in the multinational do not have authority-based or ‘structural’ power with respect to key strategic decisions [6,16], they may have ‘resource-based’ power in the form of knowledge and capabilities that is of value to the multinational as a whole. Business network analysis highlights the ‘invisibility’ of the external networks (often in the host country) to the upper echelons in the multinational through which valuable subsidiary knowledge and capabilities develop. It points out that this ‘invisibility’ undermines the headquarters’ ability to control the subsidiary [3,28,36,42,68,72]. In this paper we argue that the deployment of ERP undermines the resource base of subsidiary power and thus helps to restore greater central authority in the MNE. The paper reports findings from studies in twelve MNEs which have implemented ERP and points out that from the perspective of subsidiary managers a key effect of ERP deployment is the reduction in their autonomy. This may have significant adverse implications for the futures of the MNE as a federative organizational form and the legitimacy of MNE operations abroad.},

There is evidence that positive developmental impacts of FDI flows are conditional on high levels of human capital and thus on the existence of ‘good’ infrastructure in recipient countries.The chapter makes a conceptual contribution and critically evaluates the key points made in the Yamin and Sinkovics (2009) paper.The build-up of infrastructure and enhancement of domestic capabilities are important underpinnings of sustainable development. ‘Good’ infrastructure, especially basic social infrastructure, is the rock on which otherwise marginalised individuals, groups and country governments can build capabilities.The chapter draws attention to the ‘prisoner dilemma’ nature of the relationship between MNEs and host governments. Dominant MNE strategies in LDCs create a low payoff for both parties. To proceed towards mutually beneficial outcomes in the MNE–LDC relationship, credible and sustained co-operation between the parties are necessary. Research in the area of mutual value creation has only just emerged in the domain of IB.Progressing towards ‘sustainability’ requires that MNE managers are advised to develop a global capability in ‘social embeddedness’. LDCs have great potential of becoming strategic markets and important sites for new product and service development. To pursue these opportunities requires credible and sustained commitment to mutual value creation.This chapter shows that the relationship between MNE strategies and economic development is a contested one. The paper by Yamin and Sinkovics (2009) was one of the first in the domain of IB to suggest that developmental impacts of FDI are contingent on the existence of good infrastructure in recipient countries.},

We suggest that rising power firms offer novel capabilities, connect IB to global value chains (GVCs) and then introduce the papers in the special issue. Design/methodology/approach – The papers in the special issue are grouped under two distinct themes, one considering the capabilities of rising power firms and how these are shaped broadly by the economic and socio political features of their home countries. The second theme clusters papers that have a GVC dimension in so far as they highlight failures in upgrading, flag the disconnect between economic and social upgrading and provide a novel conceptualisation of social value creation. Findings – The international business literature has paid growing attention to the emergence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) from rising powers, notably the ‘BRICS’. One perspective, a dominant perspective in IB, sees RP MNEs as a manifestation of catch–up efforts by firms from emerging economies, another perspective suggests that rising power firms compete with distinct capabilities and business models. This special issue highlights the latter perspective.

   abstract = {The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ascribe specific roles to business organizations and have thus invigorated discussions on the link between the activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and international development. In the development of the MDGs and the SDGs, the human rights-related capabilities approach to development has featured prominently. Yet, so far, international business research on the links between MNEs and sustainable management has largely overlooked the human rights aspect. This paper integrates human rights into the debate on the role of business activities in sustainable development. Drawing on the business and human rights (BHR) governance approach, which analyses the governance mechanisms and structures that govern the relationships between human rights duty-bearers and human rights-holders in the business and human rights field, the paper argues that BHR governance can act as moderator in the design, implementation and evaluation of business policies and practices seeking to contribute to the advancement of the SDGs. It shows how BHR governance may support, positively influence and reinforce the impact of private sector activities on international sustainable development.},

While the announcement of an M&A usually elicits enthusiasm in the business community, it also results in increased levels of uncertainty, stress, and anxiety for employees. Based on a qualitative analysis of four international M&A cases, this paper integrates emotions and communication during mergers and acquisitions in a conceptual framework. We argue that management communication and information flows during all stages of an M&A process represent affective events, which in a cognitive appraisal process trigger positive and negative emotions. These in turn may influence employee attitudes, behaviour, and performance, and ultimately also M&A success. // La presse économique est fréquemment dominée par des informations portant sur les activités de fusion et d'acquisition (désormais M&A). S'il est vrai que l'annonce d'une M&A suscite de l'enthousiasme dans le monde des affaires, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'elle provoque, chez les employés, des niveaux élevés d'incertitude, de stress et d'anxiété. Dans cet article, nous nous appuyons sur une analyse qualitative de quatre cas internationaux de M&A pour intégrer, dans un cadre conceptuel, les émotions et la communication pendant les fusions et les acquisitions. Nous soutenons que la gestion de la communication et des flots d'information pendant les différentes étapes d'un processus de M&A représentent des évènements affectifs qui, dans un processus d'appréciation cognitive, créent des émotions positives ou négatives. Celles-ci pourraient influencer, à leur tour, les attitudes, les comportements et les rendements des employés, et, en fin de compte, la réussite de la M&A.},
