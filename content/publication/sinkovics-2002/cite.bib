 abstract = {Many consumers feel overloaded by the complexity of technology-related products. This renders consumers less open and may even lead to an aversion or anxiety towards this kind of products, so-called technophobia. The prevailing paper aims to establish an instrument which measures technophobia. Following a literature review and in-depth interviews with experts, a scale is developed and tested in seven different countries (U.S., U.K., France, Spain, India, Mexico and Austria, total sample size = 1503 respondents). The three underlying dimensions of the scale, namely, "Personal Failure", "Human vs. Machine Ambiguity" and "Convenience" are discussed and future research avenues to strengthen the cross-national usability of the scale are identified.},
