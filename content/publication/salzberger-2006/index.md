abstract: "Purpose – The paper investigates the suitability of the Rasch model for establishing data equivalence. The results based on a real data set are contrasted with findings from standard procedures based on CFA methods. Design/methodology/approach – Sinkovics et al.'s data on technophobia was used and re-evaluated using both classical test theory (CTT) (multiple-group structural equations modelling) and Rasch measurement theory. Findings – Data equivalence in particular and measurement in general cannot be addressed without reference to theory. While both procedures can be considered best practice approaches within their respective theoretical foundation of measurement, the Rasch model provides some theoretical virtues. Measurement derived from data that fit the Rasch model seems to be approximated by classical procedures reasonably well. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Practical implications – The more widespread application of Rasch models would lead to a stronger justification of measurement, in particular, in cross-cultural studies but also whenever measures of individual respondents are of interest. Originality/value – Measurement models outside the framework of CTT are still scarce exceptions in marketing research."
