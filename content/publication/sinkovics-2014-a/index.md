abstract: "Cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are strategic business expansions across national boundaries, which can prove rather problematic and complex. The most challenging part of the process is the integration of two different firms that feature different management styles and departmental practice. Once the integration seeps deeper into functional levels, strategic-level M&A commitment is faced with operational implementation issues. The marketing departmental function is usually heavily involved in this integration process. Research on marketing integration in relation to M&As has paid little attention to the process of combining similar resources from two similar departments, particularly in the cross-border M&A context. Furthermore, existing research does not clearly demonstrate the success factors that contribute to the marketing integration process in M&As. Hence, this paper discusses the phenomenon of marketing integration in the cross-border M&A context. Collaboration, interaction, marketing synergy and redeployment of marketing resources are proposed as antecedents to the integration. Drawing from the extant literature, propositions are developed, and mechanisms to improve M&A integration performance are elaborated."
