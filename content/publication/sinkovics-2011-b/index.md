abstract: "•  The focus theme International integration and coordination in MNEs—Implications for international management is introduced and the motivation for this focus issue theme is outlined. The premise of the theme is the notion that the nature of organizational response to heightened global dynamism has changed. It is argued that the managerial mechanisms or tools necessary to accomplish coordination tasks have changed accordingly. •  The manuscripts included in this focused issue capture this perspective building conceptual and empirical contributions. These include cross-border knowledge transfer, global strategy implementation, IT integration as enabler of MNE-supplier responsiveness, intra-firm architectural network configuration, regional integration perspectives from Latin America and integration and coordination in the global factory."
