abstract: "A sound conceptualization of international e-risks has grown in demand, because of the increasing penetration of the Internet, and specifically the enabling-facility of the Internet technology for small firms. Yet, to date, there has been no study explicitly attempting to build an international business risk framework for the online environment, nor to explain online internationalization decisions. The purpose of the present paper is threefold, (1) to combine and complement the existing traditional international risk constructs and the emerging views on e-business risks into a comprehensive and unified international risk framework for the online context; (2) to develop propositions regarding SMEs' active online internationalization decisions by drawing on Dunning's OLI framework; and (3) to explore the online-offline risk trade-off inherent in online internationalization decisions by integrating the e-risk framework into the eclectic paradigm."
