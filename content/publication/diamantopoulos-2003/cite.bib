 abstract = {This paper explores whether socio-demographics still have a role to play in profiling green consumers. Following an inter-disciplinary review of the literature, the second part of the paper attempts to address shortcomings identified in previous research. Specifically, hypotheses are developed concerning the relationship between six key socio-demographic variables and five valid and reliable measures of environmental consciousness. These hypotheses are subsequently tested on a large nationwide sample of British consumers and conclusions drawn on the utility of socio-demographic variables for profiling green consumers.},
