abstract: "The strategy/performance paradigm has long been accepted within the management discipline as a framework to explain a firm's survival in the market environment (Chandler 1962; Chandler and Hanks 1994; Luo 1999; Mintzberg 1983; Porter 1979, 1980, 1985). Strategy influences and directs the conduct of day-to-day business operations. It also provides a foundation for longterm success. However, the strategy-performance relationship may not be direct, especially given the increased reliance upon relationships to achieve strategic goals. In fact, previous research has conceptualized an indirect relationship between strategic orientation and performance (Han, Kim, and Srivastava 1998). Organizational capabilities may impact performance as well, i.e., mediate the strategy-performance relationship. If efforts are focused on developing the \"right\" capabilities, performance will be enhanced. The current study empirically investigates proposed, theoretically-based relationships between strategy and performance within an interorganizational context. i.e., manufacturer - 3PL (thirdparty logistics providers) relationships. Capabilities within this context are operationalized in terms of operational flexibility and collaboration. These capabilities are enhanced through interaction between the firms. In the following sections, relevant literature is reviewed and used to introduce key constructs and develop a model of the proposed relationships. The presentation of research hypotheses, discussion of research methodology, results, and the theoretical/managerial implications of the research follow this section."
