 abstract = {The book is based on the best papers presented at the 32nd Annual Conference of the UK Chapter of the Academy of International Business. With enlargement of the European Union in June 2004, the year witnessed the incorporation of 10 new member states. This enlargement presents significant economic, political and social challenges, but also provides major opportunities for collaboration between firms, governments and organisations.
