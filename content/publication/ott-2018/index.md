QCA has recently become popular, as it sets out to integrate the strengths of qualitative and quantitative methods while overcoming the key concerns inherent in both the approaches. This chapter discusses and explains the QCA method and highlights the possible application of the method in business and management research. The chapter offers an application example and concludes with suggestions regarding future avenues for using QCA approach in the field of management research."
