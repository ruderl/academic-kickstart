 abstract = {The existence of rapidly internationalising small to medium sized firms has been widely documented in the literature. Liberalisation of markets and the emergence of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are the most frequently cited enablers of this phenomenon. However, despite their unprecedented potential to reach customers and reduce trade barriers, the anticipated positive impact of ICTs on firm performance has not been empirically supported to the expected degree. This study addresses this topical issue and investigates the effect of online media use on export performance by using multivariate statistical analysis on data drawn from a survey of 115 UK-based SMEs.},

 note = {This impressive Handbook provides a dynamic perspective on the development of successful born global firms, including evolutionary phases and pathways of growth, emergence of entire born global industries, role of founders' linkages, experience, culture and training, as well as collaboration with large MNEs. The expert contributors and the editors explore the origin and evolution of born globals and the changing history of this sector. They outline the training involved in developing international intellectual entrepreneurs and study the effects of different cultures on the origin and growth of born globals. The Handbook focuses on the different types of born globals that emerge from the general set of SMEs - ranging from the pure born globals to the born again globals, the born regionals, and their sub group of born again regionals. It also innovatively differentiates these from internationalizing SMEs and international new ventures. Providing a dynamic perspective on the development of successful born global firms, this book will prove essential reading for researchers and students of international business. Founders of born global firms will also learn about novel management practices, whilst educational institutions and governments will find invaluable insights on how to foster the emergence of successful born globals. // Description: 'The immense literature on born globals contains a cottage industry of research that includes many different definitions, operationalizations and conclusions. It is time to reflect on what insights we have gained. The editors have really succeeded in putting a highly needed great Handbook together that presents this at its best. It will stimulate further research. It is an appealing, useful and well crafted end product.' - Torben Pedersen, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark // Contents: Contributors: A. Aspelund, M.
