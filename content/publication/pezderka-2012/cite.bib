 abstract = {The existence of rapidly internationalising small to medium sized firms has been widely documented in the literature. Liberalisation of markets and the emergence of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are the most frequently cited enablers of this phenomenon. However, despite their unprecedented potential to reach customers and reduce trade barriers, the anticipated positive impact of ICTs on firm performance has not been empirically supported to the expected degree. This study addresses this topical issue and investigates the effect of online media use on export performance by using multivariate statistical analysis on data drawn from a survey of 115 UK-based SMEs.},
