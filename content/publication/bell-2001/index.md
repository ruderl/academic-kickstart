abstract: "In an increasingly global environment, marketing educators face a growing challenge in terms of internationalizing offerings. Much of the focus of recent developments centres on the development of distance education programs, with the proliferation of such offerings. However, rather less attention has been paid to how the new technologies can be utilized to enhance existing, more conventional programs. Utilizing a framework proposed by Arpan et al (1993), Kwok & Arpan (1994) and Kwok et al (1994), this contribution focuses on the application of new technologies in order to enhance and 'internetionalize' extant academic provisions, specifically in the area of International Marketing. The authors contend that the new information technologies provide excellent opportunities to internationalize international marketing courses in a very creative and cost-effective manner. Recent examples of how this has been achieved via the use of the World Wide Web (WWW), video conferencing and other emerging educational technologies are provided. Other ideas as to how these technologies might be useful applied are also suggested."
