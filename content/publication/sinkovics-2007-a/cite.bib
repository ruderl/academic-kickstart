 abstract = {This volume deals with 'anxieties' in international business and their managerial ramifications. A key actor in the international business environment is the multinational enterprise (MNE) and one can make the case that the organization and politics of the MNE is a potential pool of anxiety. Anxieties are also manifest from the perspectives of countries and localities impacted by MNC activities and investment. All contributions highlight the complexities of the international business environment or the managerial implication of such complexity. -- Introduction
