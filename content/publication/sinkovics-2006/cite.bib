 abstract = {The Internet is widely seen as a powerful tool to help firms overcome physical and managerial barriers to internationalisation. This is particularly true for smaller entrepreneurial firms, given their widely recognised human and financial resource limitations, restricted international experience and lack of knowledge of global markets. Many commentators argue that Internet enablement offers the prospect of removing a whole range of potential internationalisation barriers (Hamill and Gregory, 1997; Quelch and Klein, 1996; Singh and Kundu, 2002). However, while setting up websites implies instant internationalisation from a technical perspective (Kotha et al., 2001), the successful deployment of this virtual presence is restrained by functional and organisational capabilities (Prasad et al., 2001; Samiee, 1998). The Internet allows addressing potential customers without geographical restrictions, yet the successful exploitation of these market opportunities might necessitate learning by (online) experience and avoiding ‘shock effects’ (Pedersen and Petersen, 2004) when dealing with remote markets. Arguably, the pace of internationalisation is ‘compressed’ (Vermeulen and Barkema, 2002) due to the Internet, but it will be interesting to see whether smaller entrepreneurial firms can capitalise on this particular effect more so than other organisational forms. This themed issue aims to contribute to ongoing debate by looking at the interface of the Internet and International Entrepreneurship. It considers important issues such as: what are the enabling dimensions of internationalisation regarding the Internet and e-commerce? Does the Internet facilitate rapid internationalisation? How can we measure a successful online presence of SMEs and is there such a thing as E-entrepreneurship? The papers selected for this themed issue are at the interface of international entrepreneurship and the Internet and follow this theme from general to the specific. The first contribu-tion by Maria J. Nieto and Zulima Fernandez explores the role of IT in corporate strategy of SMEs. Although they argue that ICT does not necessarily constitute a source of competitive advantage in itself, it is the complimentarity with other strategic resources that counts. Their empirical example of Spanish SMEs confirms the existence of a significant relationship between ICT and international competitiveness. Hence, SMEs using ICT tend to be more heavily involved in international activities and demonstrate higher performance results. The paper by Sharon Loane provides a good case for the role of the internet in the internationalisation of SMEs. After elaborating on the ‘born global’ phenomenon, globalisation pressures and the impact of new ICT technologies, she builds on a cross national sample of small entrepreneurial firms from Canada, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Her interview material creates an understanding of the behaviour and strategies adopted by rapidly internationalising Internet enabled firms. Findings reveal the role of the Internet as a knowledge building tool in marketing, distribution, business processes, market intelligence and competitor analysis. Pia Arenius, Mika Gabrielsson and Viveca Sasi present an interesting case study on the rapid Internet-enabled internationalisation of a Finnish knowledge-intensive company. This case demonstrates that embracing the functional capabilities of the Internet may well support the theoretical advantages of rapid internationalisation. Moreover, their contribution is particularly interesting because it supports growing criticisms of the usefulness of internationalisation “stages” theories. Rasha Mostafa, Colin Wheeler and Marian Jones examine the multi-facetted construct using innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking and linking it to export performance. Their study demonstrates that entrepreneurial exporters are more committed to the Internet and in respect of growth in export sales, have better export performance. The study has strong implications for public policy in support of internationalisation, suggesting that upgrading SMEs ICT knowledge and usage will lead to stronger performance on international markets. The paper by Rudolf Sinkovics and Elfriede Penz develops the debate on Internet, SMEs and Entrepreneurship in a pragmatic yet important direction. It explores a new construct of “Web-Empowerment”. Although the quality of websites is deemed a crucial element for the communication with stakeholders, web-design for smaller firms is guided by practical approaches rather than conceptual considerations. The web-empowerment scale proposed provides a valuable tool that can empower entrepreneurs to approach web-design more strategically in order to benefit from a competitive online presence. The final paper in the themed issue by Elaine Ramsey and Patrick Ibbotson discusses e-entrepreneurial firms. The authors take a macro and micro-perspective on entrepreneurial enterprises and discuss e-opportunities for economic development and the internationalisation of small Irish firms. They argue that the willingness to embrace e-business will determine the future success of Ireland in the digital economy. They also outline future directions for policy makers.},
