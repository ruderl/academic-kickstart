abstract: "Situated within the broader conference theme of historical change, this panel session brought together international business and economic geography perspectives on multinational enterprise (MNE) evolutionary trajectories. The panel session follows a series of past conference sessions aimed to increase dialogue and interaction between economic geographers and international business scholars. These included several sessions at the Royal Geographical Society and Institute of Geographer’s Annual Conference in 2010 and the Association of International Business in 2012. The aim for this conference panel session was for panellists to offer a range of empirical and conceptual observations to interrogate our existing understandings of the spatial and historical development of MNEs. While space and time often provide distinct lenses on the operations of MNEs, the panel discussed the ways in which the two can be combined to provide more nuanced conceptualisations and frameworks for analysis, which can powerfully complement existing conceptual frameworks and methodological approaches in international business. This chapter is a record of the panel session and, as such, offers a direct representation of the speakers’ presentations, their discussions and their question and answer session. The chapter begins with Martin Hess’ discussion of continuity and change in MNEs and global production networks, followed by Rudolf Sinkovics’ analysis of the uptake of economic geography work on global sourcing by international business. Liam Campling then introduces us to commodity chains and commodity frontiers before Peter Buckley offers a summary and discussion of the key debates and issues raised. The chapter includes the questions posed to the panel and the answers and discussion offered in response."
