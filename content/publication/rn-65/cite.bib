 abstract = {This paper offers a new methodological framework to guide researchers attempting to quantitatively assess how a standardized television advertisement is perceived by a pluralistic audience. Rasch (1960) measurement theory is introduced as an alternative to the more commonly employed multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach to assessing cross-cultural scalar equivalence. By analyzing a multi-cultural data set, we are able to make various inferences concerning the scalar equivalence of Schlinger's confusion scale. The methodology reveals the limits of the scale, which in all probability would not have been detected using traditional approaches. For researchers attempting to develop new scales, or even to refine existing scales, strict adherence to established guidelines of item generation together with the application of the proposed methodology should ensure better results for both theorists and practitioners.},
