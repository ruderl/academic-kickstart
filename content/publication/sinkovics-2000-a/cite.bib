 abstract = {In many countries, the system of business education at universities and colleges has been an important topic of public scrutiny and discussion. Universities in German speaking countries and regions are no exception. Critical statements range from a lack of practical relevance in teaching and research to the need to increase research output. This paper aims to investigate how marketing faculty deal with such pressures. Based on a census of all German speaking marketing professors at German, Swiss, and Austrian universities and polytechnics, the analysis probes the status-quo and satisfaction with the current work environment. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving the working conditions of German speaking marketing academics and identifies some promising future research avenues.},
