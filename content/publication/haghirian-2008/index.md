abstract: "The recession during the last decade hit Japan’s image as an economic powerhouse hard. It added a layer of skepticism to the already existing difficulties in coping with tariff and non-tariff entry barriers as well as cultural and business differences. However, even against the background of strong economic transformations in countries such as India and especially China and a strong enthusiasm in dealing with these upcoming economies, it should not be forgotten that Japan is still the world’s second largest economy in terms of GDP. Japan offers an array of business opportunities for foreign investors. As employment and other traditions are under pressure from a young generation more in tune with western culture and ideas, the Japanese triad-market allows for a promising future. This article aims to initiate managers, who wish to extend their market reach, to the tremendous opportunities of the Japanese market. We unveil cultural particulars and challenges for foreign businesses that allow for a refreshed look into the economic miracle of the second half of the twentieth century."
