abstract: "• Building upon knowledge-based and network views, this paper seeks to examine how subsidiary characteristics (subsidiary willingness and subsidiary external embeddedness) and relationship characteristics (internal embeddedness, socialization mechanisms and shared values) impact the extent of Reverse Knowledge Transfer (RKT). • A survey was carried out to build a database of 178 subsidiaries operating in Knowledge Intensive Business Service (KIBS) sectors in the United Kingdom. • Our analysis indicates that willingness and socialization mechanisms are the most significant determinants of the extent of RKT. Further, the impacts of shared values and internal embeddedness are mediated by subsidiary willingness. The results also highlight the significant association between socialization mechanisms and internal embeddedness. Contrary to our expectation, external embeddedness has a negative influence on the extent of RKT."
