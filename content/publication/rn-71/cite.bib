 abstract = {Exporting manufacturers rely on international distributors for local market knowledge and access. Unfortunately, the geographical and cultural separation poses severe challenges to relationship mechanics and outcomes. This study examines two distinct relational governance mechanisms, relationship commitment and trust. The Uppsala internationalization model is used to explore the issues associated with an exporting manufacturer's strategic objective of achieving effective market entry through a proactive approach involving market learning. Market learning is enhanced through governance. The analysis of 141 US exporting manufacturers provides support for the perspective of relational governance as a hybrid mechanism which both facilitates and augments learning between cross-border organizations. Flexibility is enhanced and relationship outcomes are more satisfactory.},
