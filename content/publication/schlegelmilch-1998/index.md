abstract: "Asserts that new technology will completely change the business environment as we know it. Highlights the interrelated changes that are already occurring: mushroom companies; virtual enterprises; electronic markets; blurring industry boundaries; and \"fragvergence\" of cultural differences. Outlines the implications for marketing management. For instance, suggests that the majority of all marketing activities will have to be international, as target groups are scattered throughout different countries; market research on the Internet will increase in importance; efficient and quick promotion of ideas, business concepts and services is essential; enhanced customer intimacy; and reduction of price flexibility."
