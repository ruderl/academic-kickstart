 abstract = {Purpose: This paper discusses partial least squares path modeling (PLS), a powerful structural equation modeling technique for research on international marketing. While a significant body of research provides guidance for the use of covariance-based structural equation modeling (CBSEM) in international marketing, there are no subject-specific guidelines for the use of PLS so far. / Methodology/approach: A literature review of the use of PLS in international marketing reveals the increasing application of this methodology. / Findings: This paper reveals the strengths and weaknesses of PLS in the context of research on international marketing, and provides guidance for multi-group analysis. / Originality/value of paper: The paper assists researchers in making well-grounded decisions regarding the application of PLS in certain research situations and provides specific implications for an appropriate application of the methodology.},

 note = {The advent of structural equation modeling (SEM) with latent variables has changed the nature of research in international marketing and management. Researchers acknowledge the possibilities of distinguishing between measurement and structural models and explicitly taking measurement error intoaccount. As Gefen, Straub, and Boudreau( 2000,p.6) point out, ‘‘SEM has become de rigueur in validating in struments and testing linkages between constructs.’’ They further more distinguish between two families of SEM techniques: covariance-based techniques, as represented by LISREL, and variance-based techniques, of which partial least squares (PLS) path modeling is the most prominent representative.},
