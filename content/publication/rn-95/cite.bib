 abstract = {Information technology (IT) innovations have and continue to have a significant impact on international marketing practice and customer interactions. With the marketing environment becoming increasingly dependent on technology, marketing teaching in higher education faces a challenging task of effectively leveraging technology in diverse learning environments. This paper investigates key developments of recent years and explores drivers of learnersâ€™ satisfaction within two different IT-based learning environments. Both virtual classrooms via video conferencing technology and the use of simulations for testing international marketing campaigns will be investigated. Factors which contribute to successful teaching outcomes by means of these technologies are identified. A learner satisfaction model for IT-based learning environments is used for identification of these factors and recommendations for marketing educators based on the evaluation of the results are given.},
