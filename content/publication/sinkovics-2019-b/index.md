abstract: "This chapter aims at taking stock of business-responsibility-related studies in international business (IB) research. Key features of this literature review include (1) a broad search strategy capturing both positive and negative aspects of responsibility, (2) not imposing any constraints on the time period, and (3) extending the search to all IB journals included in the Web of Science database. By incorporating both responsible and irresponsible behavior in the search strategy, we are able to provide a holistic map of responsibility-related research in IB."
