 abstract = {A core component of International Business (IB) postgraduate programs around the world is the master?s dissertation, which requires students to produce a written document, typically around 20,000 words in length, based on empirical research. While the dissertation is given considerable importance in such programs, often accounting for more than a quarter of a candidate?s final grade, the effectiveness of the dissertation in delivering outcomes remains largely unknown. This article addresses this shortcoming by providing an empirical understanding of the perceived usefulness and value of master?s-level dissertations and evaluating their impact on the personal and intellectual development of students. Findings demonstrate the unique ability of the dissertation to enhance student employability, both for scientifically interested and deep learners as well as for functional learners.},
