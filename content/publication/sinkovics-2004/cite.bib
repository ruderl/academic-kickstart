 abstract = {Many researchers claim that the use of web-based learning tools and information and communication technology (ICT) will revolutionize traditional learning methods in university contexts and fundamentally change the process of how knowledge is gathered and disseminated. However, there are conflicting views regarding the benefits of these techniques and actual learning outcomes. This paper posits that by using ICT and particularly the Web as a dynamic and integrating learning tool, several strategic competencies can be deployed and that the international knowledge, skills and competencies of entrepreneurship students can be radically enhanced. In light of an extensive literature review on research in the field, suggestions are provided for using the Web as a comprehensive teaching tool.},
